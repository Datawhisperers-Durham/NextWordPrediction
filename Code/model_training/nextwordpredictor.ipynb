Thumb X The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor XI The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet XII The Adventure of the Copper Beeches I A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA I To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler All emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind He was I take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position He never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer They were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results Grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his And yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late Irene Adler of dubious and questionable memory I had seen little of Holmes lately My marriage had drifted us away from each other My own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while Holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in Baker Street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature He was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland Beyond these signs of his activity however which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press I knew little of my former friend and companion One nightit was on the twentieth of March 1888I was returning from a journey to a patient for I had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through Baker Street As I passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers His rooms were brilliantly lit and even as I looked up I saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind He was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him To me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story He was at work again He had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own His manner was not effusive It seldom was but he was glad I think to see me With hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion Wedlock suits you he remarked I think Watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you Seven I answered Indeed I should have thought a little more Just a trifle more I fancy Watson And in practice again I observe You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness Then how do you know I see it I deduce it How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl My dear Holmes said I this is too much You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as I have changed my clothes I cant imagine how you deduce it As to Mary Jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again I fail to see how you work it out He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together It is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it Hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the London slavey As to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction When I hear you give your reasons I remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours Quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair You see but you do not observe The distinction is clear For example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room Frequently How often Well some hundreds of times Then how many are there How many I dont know Quite so You have not observed And yet you have seen That is just my point Now I know that there are seventeen steps because I have both seen and observed By the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this He threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table It came by the last post said he Read it aloud The note was undated and without either signature or address There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated This account of you we have from all quarters received Be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask This is indeed a mystery I remarked What do you imagine that it means I have no data yet It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts But the note itself What do you deduce from it I carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written The man who wrote it was presumably well to do I remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet It is peculiarly strong and stiff Peculiarthat is the very word said Holmes It is not an English paper at all Hold it up to the light I did so and saw a large E with a small g a P and a large G with a small t woven into the texture of the paper What do you make of that asked Holmes The name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather Not at all The G with the small t stands for Gesellschaft which is the German for Company It is a customary contraction like our Co P of course stands for Papier Now for the Eg Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves Eglow Eglonitzhere we are Egria It is in a Germanspeaking countryin Bohemia not far from Carlsbad Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills Ha ha my boy what do you make of that His eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette The paper was made in Bohemia I said Precisely And the man who wrote the note is a German Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentenceThis account of you we have from all quarters received A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs It only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face And here he comes if I am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell Holmes whistled A pair by the sound said he Yes he continued glancing out of the window A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties A hundred and fifty guineas apiece Theres money in this case Watson if there is nothing else I think that I had better go Holmes Not a bit Doctor Stay where you are I am lost without my Boswell And this promises to be interesting It would be a pity to miss it But your client Never mind him I may want your help and so may he Here he comes Sit down in that armchair Doctor and give us your best attention A slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door Then there was a loud and authoritative tap Come in said Holmes A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a Hercules His dress was rich with a richness which would in England be looked upon as akin to bad taste Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl Boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance He carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy You had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent I told you that I would call He looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address Pray take a seat said Holmes This is my friend and colleague Dr Watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases Whom have I the honour to address You may address me as the Count Von Kramm a Bohemian nobleman I understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance If not I should much prefer to communicate with you alone I rose to go but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair It is both or none said he You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me The Count shrugged his broad shoulders Then I must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history I promise said Holmes And I You will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own I was aware of it said Holmes dryly The circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe To speak plainly the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein hereditary kings of Bohemia I was also aware of that murmured Holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client If your Majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked I should be better able to advise you The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation Then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground You are right he cried I am the King Why should I attempt to conceal it Why indeed murmured Holmes Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein Grand Duke of CasselFelstein and hereditary King of Bohemia But you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you Then pray consult said Holmes shutting his eyes once more The facts are briefly these Some five years ago during a lengthy visit to Warsaw I made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress Irene Adler The name is no doubt familiar to you Kindly look her up in my index Doctor murmured Holmes without opening his eyes For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes Let me see said Holmes Hum Born in New Jersey in the year 1858 Contraltohum La Scala hum Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsawyes Retired from operatic stageha Living in Londonquite so Your Majesty as I understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back Precisely so But how Was there a secret marriage None No legal papers or certificates None Then I fail to follow your Majesty If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity There is the writing Pooh pooh Forgery My private notepaper Stolen My own seal Imitated My photograph Bought We were both in the photograph Oh dear That is very bad Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion I was madinsane You have compromised yourself seriously I was only Crown Prince then I was young I am but thirty now It must be recovered We have tried and failed Your Majesty must pay It must be bought She will not sell Stolen then Five attempts have been made Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled Twice she has been waylaid There has been no result No sign of it Absolutely none Holmes laughed It is quite a pretty little problem said he But a very serious one to me returned the King reproachfully Very indeed And what does she propose to do with the photograph To ruin me But how I am about to be married So I have heard To Clotilde Lothman von SaxeMeningen second daughter of the King of Scandinavia You may know the strict principles of her family She is herself the very soul of delicacy A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end And Irene Adler Threatens to send them the photograph And she will do it I know that she will do it You do not know her but she has a soul of steel She has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men Rather than I should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone You are sure that she has not sent it yet I am sure And why Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed That will be next Monday Oh then we have three days yet said Holmes with a yawn That is very fortunate as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present Your Majesty will of course stay in London for the present Certainly You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress Pray do so I shall be all anxiety Then as to money You have carte blanche Absolutely I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph And for present expenses The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him And Mademoiselles address he asked Is Briony Lodge Serpentine Avenue St Johns Wood Holmes took a note of it One other question said he Was the photograph a cabinet It was Then goodnight your Majesty and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you And goodnight Watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street If you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three oclock I should like to chat this little matter over with you II At three oclock precisely I was at Baker Street but Holmes had not yet returned The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning I sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be I was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own Indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head It was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room Accustomed as I was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he With a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old Putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes Well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair What is it Its quite too funny I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning or what I ended by doing I cant imagine I suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of Miss Irene Adler Quite so but the sequel was rather unusual I will tell you however I left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men Be one of them and you will know all that there is to know I soon found Briony Lodge It is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories Chubb lock to the door Large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open Behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest I then lounged down the street and found as I expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to And what of Irene Adler I asked Oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet So say the Serpentinemews to a man She lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner Seldom goes out at other times except when she sings Has only one male visitor but a good deal of him He is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice He is a Mr Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentinemews and knew all about him When I had listened to all they had to tell I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter He was a lawyer That sounded ominous What was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits Was she his client his friend or his mistress If the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping If the latter it was less likely On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the Temple It was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry I fear that I bore you with these details but I have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation I am following you closely I answered I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman sprang out He was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom I had heard He appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home He was in the house about half an hour and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms Of her I could see nothing Presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before As he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly Drive like the devil he shouted first to Gross Hankeys in Regent Street and then to the Church of St Monica in the Edgeware Road Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes Away they went and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles It hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for The Church of St Monica John she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes This was quite too good to lose Watson I was just balancing whether I should run for it or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but I jumped in before he could object The Church of St Monica said I and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes It was twentyfive minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind My cabby drove fast I dont think I ever drove faster but the others were there before us The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived I paid the man and hurried into the church There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church Suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me Thank God he cried Youll do Come Come What then I asked Come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal I was halfdragged up to the altar and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which I knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler spinster to Godfrey Norton bachelor It was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now It seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man The bride gave me a sovereign and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion This is a very unexpected turn of affairs said I and what then Well I found my plans very seriously menaced It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part At the church door however they separated he driving back to the Temple and she to her own house I shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him I heard no more They drove away in different directions and I went off to make my own arrangements Which are Some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell I have been too busy to think of food and I am likely to be busier still this evening By the way Doctor I shall want your cooperation I shall be delighted You dont mind breaking the law Not in the least Nor running a chance of arrest Not in a good cause Oh the cause is excellent Then I am your man I was sure that I might rely on you But what is it you wish When Mrs Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you Now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided I must discuss it while I eat for I have not much time It is nearly five now In two hours we must be on the scene of action Miss Irene or Madame rather returns from her drive at seven We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her And what then You must leave that to me I have already arranged what is to occur There is only one point on which I must insist You must not interfere come what may You understand I am to be neutral To do nothing whatever There will probably be some small unpleasantness Do not join in it It will end in my being conveyed into the house Four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open You are to station yourself close to that open window Yes You are to watch me for I will be visible to you Yes And when I raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what I give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire You quite follow me Entirely It is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket It is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting Your task is confined to that When you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people You may then walk to the end of the street and I will rejoin you in ten minutes I hope that I have made myself clear I am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street Precisely Then you may entirely rely on me That is excellent I think perhaps it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded Nonconformist clergyman His broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr John Hare alone could have equalled It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume His expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed The stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue It was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected On the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths You see remarked Holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters The photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr Godfrey Norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess Now the question is Where are we to find the photograph Where indeed It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her It is cabinet size Too large for easy concealment about a womans dress She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched Two attempts of the sort have already been made We may take it then that she does not carry it about with her Where then Her banker or her lawyer There is that double possibility But I am inclined to think neither Women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting Why should she hand it over to anyone else She could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man Besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days It must be where she can lay her hands upon it It must be in her own house But it has twice been burgled Pshaw They did not know how to look But how will you look I will not look What then I will get her to show me But she will refuse She will not be able to But I hear the rumble of wheels It is her carriage Now carry out my orders to the letter As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge As it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention A fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side A blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man Irene Adler as I will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street Is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked He is dead cried several voices No no theres life in him shouted another But hell be gone before you can get him to hospital Hes a brave fellow said a woman They would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him They were a gang and a rough one too Ah hes breathing now He cant lie in the street May we bring him in marm Surely Bring him into the sittingroom There is a comfortable sofa This way please Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window The lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me I hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under my ulster After all I thought we are not injuring her We are but preventing her from injuring another Holmes had sat up upon the couch and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air A maid rushed across and threw open the window At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of Fire The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servant maidsjoined in a general shriek of Fire Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window I caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road You did it very nicely Doctor he remarked Nothing could have been better It is all right You have the photograph I know where it is And how did you find out She showed me as I told you she would I am still in the dark I do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing The matter was perfectly simple You of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice They were all engaged for the evening I guessed as much Then when the row broke out I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand I rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle It is an old trick That also I could fathom Then they carried me in She was bound to have me in What else could she do And into her sittingroom which was the very room which I suspected It lay between that and her bedroom and I was determined to see which They laid me on a couch I motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance How did that help you It was allimportant When a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most It is a perfectly overpowering impulse and I have more than once taken advantage of it In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me and also in the Arnsworth Castle business A married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox Now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of She would rush to secure it The alarm of fire was admirably done The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel She responded beautifully The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bellpull She was there in an instant and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out When I cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and I have not seen her since I rose and making my excuses escaped from the house I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait A little overprecipitance may ruin all And now I asked Our quest is practically finished I shall call with the King tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us We will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands And when will you call At eight in the morning She will not be up so that we shall have a clear field Besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits I must wire to the King without delay We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said Goodnight Mister Sherlock Holmes There were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by Ive heard that voice before said Holmes staring down the dimly lit street Now I wonder who the deuce that could have been III I slept at Baker Street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room You have really got it he cried grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face Not yet But you have hopes I have hopes Then come I am all impatience to be gone We must have a cab No my brougham is waiting Then that will simplify matters We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge Irene Adler is married remarked Holmes Married When Yesterday But to whom To an English lawyer named Norton But she could not love him I am in hopes that she does And why in hopes Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance If the lady loves her husband she does not love your Majesty If she does not love your Majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majestys plan It is true And yet Well I wish she had been of my own station What a queen she would have made He relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue The door of Briony Lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham Mr Sherlock Holmes I believe said she I am Mr Holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze Indeed My mistress told me that you were likely to call She left this morning with her husband by the 515 train from Charing Cross for the Continent What Sherlock Holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise Do you mean that she has left England Never to return And the papers asked the King hoarsely All is lost We shall see He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the King and myself The furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight Holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to Sherlock Holmes Esq To be left till called for My friend tore it open and we all three read it together It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMESYou really did it very well You took me in completely Until after the alarm of fire I had not a suspicion But then when I found how I had betrayed myself I began to think I had been warned against you months ago I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you And your address had been given me Yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know Even after I became suspicious I found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman But you know I have been trained as an actress myself Male costume is nothing new to me I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives I sent John the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as I call them and came down just as you departed Well I followed you to your door and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr Sherlock Holmes Then I rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for the Temple to see my husband We both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow As to the photograph your client may rest in peace I love and am loved by a better man than he The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged I keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future I leave a photograph which he might care to possess and I remain dear Mr Sherlock Holmes Very truly yours IRENE NORTON ne ADLER What a womanoh what a woman cried the King of Bohemia when we had all three read this epistle Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was Would she not have made an admirable queen Is it not a pity that she was not on my level From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty said Holmes coldly I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majestys business to a more successful conclusion On the contrary my dear sir cried the King nothing could be more successful I know that her word is inviolate The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire I am glad to hear your Majesty say so I am immensely indebted to you Pray tell me in what way I can reward you This ring He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly said Holmes You have but to name it This photograph The King stared at him in amazement Irenes photograph he cried Certainly if you wish it I thank your Majesty Then there is no more to be done in the matter I have the honour to wish you a very good morning He bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia and how the best plans of Mr Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a womans wit He used to make merry over the cleverness of women but I have not heard him do it of late And when he speaks of Irene Adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman II THE REDHEADED LEAGUE I had called upon my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair With an apology for my intrusion I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me You could not possibly have come at a better time my dear Watson he said cordially I was afraid that you were engaged So I am Very much so Then I can wait in the next room Not at all This gentleman Mr Wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes Try the settee said Holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods I know my dear Watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me I observed You will remember that I remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting You did Doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right Now Mr Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to Perhaps Mr Wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative I ask you not merely because my friend Dr Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips As a rule when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat As he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee I took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance I did not gain very much however by my inspection Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman obese pompous and slow He wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament A frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him Altogether look as I would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features Sherlock Holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a Freemason that he has been in China and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately I can deduce nothing else Mr Jabez Wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion How in the name of goodfortune did you know all that Mr Holmes he asked How did you know for example that I did manual labour Its as true as gospel for I began as a ships carpenter Your hands my dear sir Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left You have worked with it and the muscles are more developed Well the snuff then and the Freemasonry I wont insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin Ah of course I forgot that But the writing What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk Well but China The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject That trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China When in addition I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple Mr Jabez Wilson laughed heavily Well I never said he I thought at first that you had done something clever but I see that there was nothing in it after all I begin to think Watson said Holmes that I make a mistake in explaining Omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid Can you not find the advertisement Mr Wilson Yes I have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column Here it is This is what began it all You just read it for yourself sir I took the paper from him and read as follows TO THE REDHEADED LEAGUE On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins of Lebanon Pennsylvania USA there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 a week for purely nominal services All redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible Apply in person on Monday at eleven oclock to Duncan Ross at the offices of the League 7 Popes Court Fleet Street What on earth does this mean I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits It is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he And now Mr Wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes You will first make a note Doctor of the paper and the date It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27 1890 Just two months ago Very good Now Mr Wilson Well it is just as I have been telling you Mr Sherlock Holmes said Jabez Wilson mopping his forehead I have a small pawnbrokers business at Coburg Square near the City Its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living I used to be able to keep two assistants but now I only keep one and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business What is the name of this obliging youth asked Sherlock Holmes His name is Vincent Spaulding and hes not such a youth either Its hard to say his age I should not wish a smarter assistant Mr Holmes and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him But after all if he is satisfied why should I put ideas in his head Why indeed You seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes under the full market price It is not a common experience among employers in this age I dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement Oh he has his faults too said Mr Wilson Never was such a fellow for photography Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures That is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker Theres no vice in him He is still with you I presume Yes sir He and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthats all I have in the house for I am a widower and never had any family We live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more The first thing that put us out was that advertisement Spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says I wish to the Lord Mr Wilson that I was a redheaded man Why that I asks Why says he heres another vacancy on the League of the Redheaded Men Its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money If my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into Why what is it then I asked You see Mr Holmes I am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat In that way I didnt know much of what was going on outside and I was always glad of a bit of news Have you never heard of the League of the Redheaded Men he asked with his eyes open Never Why I wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies And what are they worth I asked Oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations Well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy Tell me all about it said I Well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars As far as I can make out the League was founded by an American millionaire Ezekiah Hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways He was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do But said I there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply Not so many as you might think he answered You see it is really confined to Londoners and to grown men This American had started from London when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn Then again I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red Now if you cared to apply Mr Wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds Now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me He was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement I never hope to see such a sight as that again Mr Holmes From north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement Fleet Street was choked with redheaded folk and Popes Court looked like a costers orange barrow I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement Every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange brick Irishsetter liver clay but as Spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecoloured tint When I saw how many were waiting I would have given it up in despair but Spaulding would not hear of it How he did it I could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office There was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office Your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff Pray continue your very interesting statement There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine He said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all However when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us This is Mr Jabez Wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League And he is admirably suited for it the other answered He has every requirement I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine He took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful Then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success It would be injustice to hesitate said he You will however I am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution With that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until I yelled with the pain There is water in your eyes said he as he released me I perceive that all is as it should be But we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint I could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled A groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of the manager My name said he is Mr Duncan Ross and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor Are you a married man Mr Wilson Have you a family I answered that I had not His face fell immediately Dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed I am sorry to hear you say that The fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor My face lengthened at this Mr Holmes for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right In the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties Well it is a little awkward for I have a business already said I Oh never mind about that Mr Wilson said Vincent Spaulding I should be able to look after that for you What would be the hours I asked Ten to two Now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening Mr Holmes especially Thursday and Friday evening which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings Besides I knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up That would suit me very well said I And the pay Is 4 a week And the work Is purely nominal What do you call purely nominal Well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time If you leave you forfeit your whole position forever The will is very clear upon that point You dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time Its only four hours a day and I should not think of leaving said I No excuse will avail said Mr Duncan Ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else There you must stay or you lose your billet And the work Is to copy out the Encyclopdia Britannica There is the first volume of it in that press You must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair Will you be ready tomorrow Certainly I answered Then goodbye Mr Jabez Wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do I was so pleased at my own good fortune Well I thought over the matter all day and by evening I was in low spirits again for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be I could not imagine It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopdia Britannica Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing However in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow so I bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper I started off for Popes Court Well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible The table was set out ready for me and Mr Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work He started me off upon the letter A and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me At two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that I had written and locked the door of the office after me This went on day after day Mr Holmes and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work It was the same next week and the same the week after Every morning I was there at ten and every afternoon I left at two By degrees Mr Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all Still of course I never dared to leave the room for an instant for I was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that I would not risk the loss of it Eight weeks passed away like this and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the Bs before very long It cost me something in foolscap and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings And then suddenly the whole business came to an end To an end Yes sir And no later than this morning I went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack Here it is and you can read for yourself He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper It read in this fashion THE REDHEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED October 9 1890 Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter I cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head If you can do nothing better than laugh at me I can go elsewhere No no cried Holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen I really wouldnt miss your case for the world It is most refreshingly unusual But there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door I was staggered sir I did not know what to do Then I called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it Finally I went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Redheaded League He said that he had never heard of any such body Then I asked him who Mr Duncan Ross was He answered that the name was new to him Well said I the gentleman at No 4 What the redheaded man Yes Oh said he his name was William Morris He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready He moved out yesterday Where could I find him Oh at his new offices He did tell me the address Yes 17 King Edward Street near St Pauls I started off Mr Holmes but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr William Morris or Mr Duncan Ross And what did you do then asked Holmes I went home to SaxeCoburg Square and I took the advice of my assistant But he could not help me in any way He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post But that was not quite good enough Mr Holmes I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it I came right away to you And you did very wisely said Holmes Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and I shall be happy to look into it From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear Grave enough said Mr Jabez Wilson Why I have lost four pound a week As far as you are personally concerned remarked Holmes I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league On the contrary you are as I understand richer by some 30 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A You have lost nothing by them No sir But I want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me It was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you And first one or two questions Mr Wilson This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you About a month then How did he come In answer to an advertisement Was he the only applicant No I had a dozen Why did you pick him Because he was handy and would come cheap At half wages in fact Yes What is he like this Vincent Spaulding Small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement I thought as much said he Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings Yes sir He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad Hum said Holmes sinking back in deep thought He is still with you Oh yes sir I have only just left him And has your business been attended to in your absence Nothing to complain of sir Theres never very much to do of a morning That will do Mr Wilson I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two Today is Saturday and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion Well Watson said Holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all I make nothing of it I answered frankly It is a most mysterious business As a rule said Holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be It is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify But I must be prompt over this matter What are you going to do then I asked To smoke he answered It is quite a three pipe problem and I beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes He curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece Sarasate plays at the St Jamess Hall this afternoon he remarked What do you think Watson Could your patients spare you for a few hours I have nothing to do today My practice is never very absorbing Then put on your hat and come I am going through the City first and we can have some lunch on the way I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French It is introspective and I want to introspect Come along We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate and a short walk took us to SaxeCoburg Square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning It was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere Three gilt balls and a brown board with JABEZ WILSON in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids Then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses Finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked It was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in Thank you said Holmes I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand Third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door Smart fellow that observed Holmes as we walked away He is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in London and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third I have known something of him before Evidently said I Mr Wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Redheaded League I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him Not him What then The knees of his trousers And what did you see What I expected to see Why did you beat the pavement My dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk We are spies in an enemys country We know something of SaxeCoburg Square Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired SaxeCoburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted Let me see said Holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line I should like just to remember the order of the houses here It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London There is Mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank the Vegetarian Restaurant and McFarlanes carriagebuilding depot That carries us right on to the other block And now Doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play A sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums My friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuthhound Holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as I have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as I knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St Jamess Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down You want to go home no doubt Doctor he remarked as we emerged Yes it would be as well And I have some business to do which will take some hours This business at Coburg Square is serious Why serious A considerable crime is in contemplation I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it But today being Saturday rather complicates matters I shall want your help tonight At what time Ten will be early enough I shall be at Baker Street at ten Very well And I say Doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket He waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes Here I had heard what he had heard I had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the Encyclopdia down to the visit to SaxeCoburg Square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me What was this nocturnal expedition and why should I go armed Where were we going and what were we to do I had the hint from Holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game I tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation It was a quarterpast nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street Two hansoms were standing at the door and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat Ha Our party is complete said Holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack Watson I think you know Mr Jones of Scotland Yard Let me introduce you to Mr Merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure Were hunting in couples again Doctor you see said Jones in his consequential way Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed Mr Merryweather gloomily You may place considerable confidence in Mr Holmes sir said the police agent loftily He has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him It is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force Oh if you say so Mr Jones it is all right said the stranger with deference Still I confess that I miss my rubber It is the first Saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that I have not had my rubber I think you will find said Sherlock Holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting For you Mr Merryweather the stake will be some 30000 and for you Jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands John Clay the murderer thief smasher and forger Hes a young man Mr Merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London Hes a remarkable man is young John Clay His grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford His brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself Hell crack a crib in Scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next Ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight Ive had one or two little turns also with Mr John Clay and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession It is past ten however and quite time that we started If you two will take the first hansom Watson and I will follow in the second Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street We are close there now my friend remarked This fellow Merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter I thought it as well to have Jones with us also He is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession He has one positive virtue He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone Here we are and they are waiting for us We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning Our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of Mr Merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us Within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate This also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate Mr Merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes You are not very vulnerable from above Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him Nor from below said Mr Merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor Why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise I must really ask you to be a little more quiet said Holmes severely You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere The solemn Mr Merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket We have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed Then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape We are at present Doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks Mr Merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present It is our French gold whispered the director We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it Your French gold Yes We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the Bank of France It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar The crate upon which I sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject Which were very well justified observed Holmes And now it is time that we arranged our little plans I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head In the meantime Mr Merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern And sit in the dark I am afraid so I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and I thought that as we were a partie carre you might have your rubber after all But I see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light And first of all we must choose our positions These are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful I shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those Then when I flash a light upon them close in swiftly If they fire Watson have no compunction about shooting them down I placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice To me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault They have but one retreat whispered Holmes That is back through the house into SaxeCoburg Square I hope that you have done what I asked you Jones I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door Then we have stopped all the holes And now we must be silent and wait What a time it seemed From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us My limbs were weary and stiff for I feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but I could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky Jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light For a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones Its disappearance however was but momentary With a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern Over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair Its all clear he whispered Have you the chisel and the bags Great Scott Jump Archie jump and Ill swing for it Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar The other dived down the hole and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but Holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor Its no use John Clay said Holmes blandly You have no chance at all So I see the other answered with the utmost coolness I fancy that my pal is all right though I see you have got his coattails There are three men waiting for him at the door said Holmes Oh indeed You seem to have done the thing very completely I must compliment you And I you Holmes answered Your redheaded idea was very new and effective Youll see your pal again presently said Jones Hes quicker at climbing down holes than I am Just hold out while I fix the derbies I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins Have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please All right said Jones with a stare and a snigger Well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the policestation That is better said John Clay serenely He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective Really Mr Holmes said Mr Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr John Clay said Holmes I have been at some small expense over this matter which I shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Redheaded League You see Watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League and the copying of the Encyclopdia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day It was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better The method was no doubt suggested to Clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair The 4 a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands They put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation But how could you guess what the motive was Had there been women in the house I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue That however was out of the question The mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at It must then be something out of the house What could it be I thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar The cellar There was the end of this tangled clue Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London He was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end What could it be once more I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind It was not in front Then I rang the bell and as I hoped the assistant answered it We have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before I hardly looked at his face His knees were what I wished to see You must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were They spoke of those hours of burrowing The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for I walked round the corner saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that I had solved my problem When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen And how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight I asked Well when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr Jabez Wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel But it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed Saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape For all these reasons I expected them to come tonight You reasoned it out beautifully I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration It is so long a chain and yet every link rings true It saved me from ennui he answered yawning Alas I already feel it closing in upon me My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence These little problems help me to do so And you are a benefactor of the race said I He shrugged his shoulders Well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked Lhomme cest rienluvre cest tout as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand III A CASE OF IDENTITY My dear fellow said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence If we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outr results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable And yet I am not convinced of it I answered The cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked Holmes This is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter Depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace I smiled and shook my head I can quite understand your thinking so I said Of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre But hereI picked up the morning paper from the groundlet us put it to a practical test Here is the first heading upon which I come A husbands cruelty to his wife There is half a column of print but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me There is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude Indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said Holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it This is the Dundas separation case and as it happens I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it The husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller Take a pinch of snuff Doctor and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example He held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it Ah said he I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers And the ring I asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger It was from the reigning family of Holland though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems And have you any on hand just now I asked with interest Some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest They are important you understand without being interesting Indeed I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive In these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest It is possible however that I may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or I am much mistaken He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted London street Looking over his shoulder I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons Suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell I have seen those symptoms before said Holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de cur She would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication And yet even here we may discriminate When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire Here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts As he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him Do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting I did at first she answered but now I know where the letters are without looking Then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face Youve heard about me Mr Holmes she cried else how could you know all that Never mind said Holmes laughing it is my business to know things Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook If not why should you come to consult me I came to you sir because I heard of you from Mrs Etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead Oh Mr Holmes I wish you would do as much for me Im not rich but still I have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that I make by the machine and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr Hosmer Angel Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked Sherlock Holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland Yes I did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr Windibankthat is my fathertook it all He would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and I just on with my things and came right away to you Your father said Holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different Yes my stepfather I call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself And your mother is alive Oh yes mother is alive and well I wasnt best pleased Mr Holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with Mr Hardy the foreman but when Mr Windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines They got 4700 for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention Your own little income he asked does it come out of the business Oh no sir It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland It is in New Zealand stock paying 4 per cent Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but I can only touch the interest You interest me extremely said Holmes And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 I could do with much less than that Mr Holmes but you understand that as long as I live at home I dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them Of course that is only just for the time Mr Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting It brings me twopence a sheet and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day You have made your position very clear to me said Holmes This is my friend Dr Watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr Hosmer Angel A flush stole over Miss Sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket I met him first at the gasfitters ball she said They used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother Mr Windibank did not wish us to go He never did wish us to go anywhere He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sundayschool treat But this time I was set on going and I would go for what right had he to prevent He said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there And he said that I had nothing fit to wear when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer At last when nothing else would do he went off to France upon the business of the firm but we went mother and I with Mr Hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there I met Mr Hosmer Angel I suppose said Holmes that when Mr Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball Oh well he was very good about it He laughed I remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way I see Then at the gasfitters ball you met as I understand a gentleman called Mr Hosmer Angel Yes sir I met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say Mr Holmes I met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and Mr Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more No Well you know father didnt like anything of the sort He wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle But then as I used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and I had not got mine yet But how about Mr Hosmer Angel Did he make no attempt to see you Well father was going off to France again in a week and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone We could write in the meantime and he used to write every day I took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time Oh yes Mr Holmes We were engaged after the first walk that we took HosmerMr Angelwas a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Streetand What office Thats the worst of it Mr Holmes I dont know Where did he live then He slept on the premises And you dont know his address Noexcept that it was Leadenhall Street Where did you address your letters then To the Leadenhall Street Post Office to be left till called for He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so I offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us That will just show you how fond he was of me Mr Holmes and the little things that he would think of It was most suggestive said Holmes It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important Can you remember any other little things about Mr Hosmer Angel He was a very shy man Mr Holmes He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous Very retiring and gentlemanly he was Even his voice was gentle Hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech He was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare Well and what happened when Mr Windibank your stepfather returned to France Mr Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the Testament that whatever happened I would always be true to him Mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was Then when they talked of marrying within the week I began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him I didnt quite like that Mr Holmes It seemed funny that I should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but I didnt want to do anything on the sly so I wrote to father at Bordeaux where the company has its French offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding It missed him then Yes sir for he had started to England just before it arrived Ha that was unfortunate Your wedding was arranged then for the Friday Was it to be in church Yes sir but very quietly It was to be at St Saviours near Kings Cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St Pancras Hotel Hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street We got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes That was last Friday Mr Holmes and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said Holmes Oh no sir He was too good and kind to leave me so Why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened I was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us I was always to remember that I was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later It seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it Most certainly it does Your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him Yes sir I believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so And then I think that what he foresaw happened But you have no notion as to what it could have been None One more question How did your mother take the matter She was angry and said that I was never to speak of the matter again And your father Did you tell him Yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that I should hear of Hosmer again As he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me Now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine And yet what could have happened And why could he not write Oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and I cant sleep a wink at night She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it I shall glance into the case for you said Holmes rising and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further Above all try to let Mr Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life Then you dont think Ill see him again I fear not Then what has happened to him You will leave that question in my hands I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare I advertised for him in last Saturdays Chronicle said she Here is the slip and here are four letters from him Thank you And your address No 31 Lyon Place Camberwell Mr Angels address you never had I understand Where is your fathers place of business He travels for Westhouse Marbank the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street Thank you You have made your statement very clearly You will leave the papers here and remember the advice which I have given you Let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life You are very kind Mr Holmes but I cannot do that I shall be true to Hosmer He shall find me ready when he comes back For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face Quite an interesting study that maiden he observed I found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one You will find parallel cases if you consult my index in Andover in 77 and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year Old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me But the maiden herself was most instructive You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me I remarked Not invisible but unnoticed Watson You did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace Now what did you gather from that womans appearance Describe it Well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red Her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments Her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger Her boots I didnt observe She had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled Pon my word Watson you are coming along wonderfully You have really done very well indeed It is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour Never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details My first glance is always at a womans sleeve In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser As you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces The double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined The sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was I then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her It surprised me But surely it was obvious I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth Now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry And what else I asked keenly interested as I always was by my friends incisive reasoning I noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep It must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger All this is amusing though rather elementary but I must go back to business Watson Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr Hosmer Angel I held the little printed slip to the light Missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named Hosmer Angel About five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech Was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold Albert chain and grey Harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street Anybody bringing c c That will do said Holmes As to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace Absolutely no clue in them to Mr Angel save that he quotes Balzac once There is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you They are typewritten I remarked Not only that but the signature is typewritten Look at the neat little Hosmer Angel at the bottom There is a date you see but no superscription except Leadenhall Street which is rather vague The point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive Of what My dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted No that was not the point However I shall write two letters which should settle the matter One is to a firm in the City the other is to the young ladys stepfather Mr Windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow evening It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives And now Doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim I had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom Once only had I known him to fail in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel I left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer It was not until close upon six oclock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dnouement of the little mystery I found Sherlock Holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair A formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him Well have you solved it I asked as I entered Yes It was the bisulphate of baryta No no the mystery I cried Oh that I thought of the salt that I have been working upon There was never any mystery in the matter though as I said yesterday some of the details are of interest The only drawback is that there is no law I fear that can touch the scoundrel Who was he then and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland The question was hardly out of my mouth and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door This is the girls stepfather Mr James Windibank said Holmes He has written to me to say that he would be here at six Come in The man who entered was a sturdy middlesized fellow some thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes He shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair Goodevening Mr James Windibank said Holmes I think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock Yes sir I am afraid that I am a little late but I am not quite my own master you know I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public It was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point Of course I did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad Besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel On the contrary said Holmes quietly I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr Hosmer Angel Mr Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves I am delighted to hear it he said It is a curious thing remarked Holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting Unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike Some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side Now you remark in this note of yours Mr Windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r There are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study Mr Windibank Holmes continued I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man They are all typewritten In each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well Mr Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk Mr Holmes he said If you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it Certainly said Holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door I let you know then that I have caught him What where shouted Mr Windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap Oh it wont doreally it wont said Holmes suavely There is no possible getting out of it Mr Windibank It is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question Thats right Sit down and let us talk it over Our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow Itits not actionable he stammered I am very much afraid that it is not But between ourselves Windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me Now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if I go wrong The man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them It was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference It was worth an effort to preserve it The daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long Now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age But soon he found that that would not answer forever She became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball What does her clever stepfather do then He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as Mr Hosmer Angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself It was only a joke at first groaned our visitor We never thought that she would have been so carried away Very likely not However that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind She was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother Then Mr Angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced There were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else But the deception could not be kept up forever These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man As far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other I think that was the chain of events Mr Windibank Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face It may be so or it may not Mr Holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me I have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint The law cannot as you say touch you said Holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more If the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders By Jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and I think I shall just treat myself to He took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see Mr James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road Theres a coldblooded scoundrel said Holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows The case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning I remarked Well of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather Then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it You see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction And how did you verify them Having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration I knew the firm for which this man worked Having taken the printed description I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and I sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here As I expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse Marbank of Fenchurch Street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ James Windibank Voil tout And Miss Sutherland If I tell her she will not believe me You may remember the old Persian saying There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace and as much knowledge of the world IV THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY We were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and I when the maid brought in a telegram It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way Have you a couple of days to spare Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy Shall be glad if you will come with me Air and scenery perfect Leave Paddington by the 1115 What do you say dear said my wife looking across at me Will you go I really dont know what to say I have a fairly long list at present Oh Anstruther would do your work for you You have been looking a little pale lately I think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in Mr Sherlock Holmes cases I should be ungrateful if I were not seeing what I gained through one of them I answered But if I am to go I must pack at once for I have only half an hour My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller My wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise rattling away to Paddington Station Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap It is really very good of you to come Watson said he It makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him Among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past Reading Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack Have you heard anything of the case he asked Not a word I have not seen a paper for some days The London press has not had very full accounts I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars It seems from what I gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult That sounds a little paradoxical But it is profoundly true Singularity is almost invariably a clue The more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home In this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man It is a murder then Well it is conjectured to be so I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it I will explain the state of things to you as far as I have been able to understand it in a very few words Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross in Herefordshire The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr John Turner who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country One of the farms which he held that of Hatherley was let to Mr Charles McCarthy who was also an exAustralian The men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible Turner was apparently the richer man so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together McCarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and Turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood McCarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl Turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the least That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families Now for the facts On June 3rd that is on Monday last McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley He had been out with his servingman in the morning at Ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three From that appointment he never came back alive From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground One was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was William Crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of Mr Turner Both these witnesses depose that Mr McCarthy was walking alone The gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr McCarthy pass he had seen his son Mr James McCarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm To the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge A girl of fourteen Patience Moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the Boscombe Valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers She states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake Mr McCarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel She heard Mr McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight She had hardly said the words when young Mr McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper He was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross who have referred the case to the next Assizes Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt I could hardly imagine a more damning case I remarked If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered Holmes thoughtfully It may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different It must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit There are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them Miss Turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained Lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet to work out the case in his interest Lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home I am afraid said I that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing Besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr Lestrade You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding To take the first example to hand I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand side and yet I question whether Mr Lestrade would have noted even so selfevident a thing as that How on earth My dear fellow I know you well I know the military neatness which characterises you You shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference Therein lies my mtier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering What are they It appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to Hatherley Farm On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury It was a confession I ejaculated No for it was followed by a protestation of innocence Coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark On the contrary said Holmes it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds However innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness As to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him The selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one I shook my head Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence I remarked So they have And many men have been wrongfully hanged What is the young mans own account of the matter It is I am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive You will find it here and may read it for yourself He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully It ran in this way Mr James McCarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows I had been away from home for three days at Bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday the 3rd My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb the groom Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though I was not aware in which direction he was going I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side On my way I saw William Crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father I had no idea that he was in front of me When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of Cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself I then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm I had not gone more than 150 yards however when I heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again I found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured I dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired I knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to Mr Turners lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance I saw no one near my father when I returned and I have no idea how he came by his injuries He was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as I know no active enemies I know nothing further of the matter The Coroner Did your father make any statement to you before he died Witness He mumbled a few words but I could only catch some allusion to a rat The Coroner What did you understand by that Witness It conveyed no meaning to me I thought that he was delirious The Coroner What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel Witness I should prefer not to answer The Coroner I am afraid that I must press it Witness It is really impossible for me to tell you I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed The Coroner That is for the court to decide I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise Witness I must still refuse The Coroner I understand that the cry of Cooee was a common signal between you and your father Witness It was The Coroner How was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol Witness with considerable confusion I do not know A Juryman Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured Witness Nothing definite The Coroner What do you mean Witness I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open that I could think of nothing except of my father Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me It seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps When I rose from my father I looked round for it but it was gone Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help Yes it was gone You cannot say what it was No I had a feeling something was there How far from the body A dozen yards or so And how far from the edge of the wood About the same Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it Yes but with my back towards it This concluded the examination of the witness I see said I as I glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy He calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words They are all as he remarks very much against the son Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat Both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour Dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little Too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth No sir I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us And now here is my pocket Petrarch and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action We lunch at Swindon and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes It was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley and over the broad gleaming Severn found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of Ross A lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the platform In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade of Scotland Yard With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us I have ordered a carriage said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea I knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime It was very nice and complimentary of you Holmes answered It is entirely a question of barometric pressure Lestrade looked startled I do not quite follow he said How is the glass Twentynine I see No wind and not a cloud in the sky I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage tonight Lestrade laughed indulgently You have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said The case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes Still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too She has heard of you and would have your opinion though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done Why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life Her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern Oh Mr Sherlock Holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my companion I am so glad that you have come I have driven down to tell you so I know that James didnt do it I know it and I want you to start upon your work knowing it too Never let yourself doubt upon that point We have known each other since we were little children and I know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him I hope we may clear him Miss Turner said Sherlock Holmes You may rely upon my doing all that I can But you have read the evidence You have formed some conclusion Do you not see some loophole some flaw Do you not yourself think that he is innocent I think that it is very probable There now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade You hear He gives me hopes Lestrade shrugged his shoulders I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said But he is right Oh I know that he is right James never did it And about his quarrel with his father I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it In what way asked Holmes It is no time for me to hide anything James and his father had many disagreements about me Mr McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet So there were quarrels and this I am sure was one of them And your father asked Holmes Was he in favour of such a union No he was averse to it also No one but Mr McCarthy was in favour of it A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her Thank you for this information said he May I see your father if I call tomorrow I am afraid the doctor wont allow it The doctor Yes have you not heard Poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely He has taken to his bed and Dr Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered Mr McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria Ha In Victoria That is important Yes at the mines Quite so at the goldmines where as I understand Mr Turner made his money Yes certainly Thank you Miss Turner You have been of material assistance to me You will tell me if you have any news tomorrow No doubt you will go to the prison to see James Oh if you do Mr Holmes do tell him that I know him to be innocent I will Miss Turner I must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if I leave him Goodbye and God help you in your undertaking She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street I am ashamed of you Holmes said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint I am not overtender of heart but I call it cruel I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy said Holmes Have you an order to see him in prison Yes but only for you and me Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him tonight Ample Then let us do so Watson I fear that you will find it very slow but I shall only be away a couple of hours I walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel The puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day Supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade It was something terrible and deadly What could it be Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest In the surgeons deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon I marked the spot upon my own head Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind That was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father Still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell Still it might be worth while to call Holmes attention to it Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat What could that mean It could not be delirium A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious No it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate But what could it indicate I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was I did not wonder at Lestrades opinion and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthys innocence It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned He came back alone for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town The glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground On the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey I have seen young McCarthy And what did you learn from him Nothing Could he throw no light None at all I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else He is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and I should think sound at heart I cannot admire his taste I remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner Ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale This fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office No one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner On the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol and his father did not know where he was Mark that point It is of importance Good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard so that there is really no tie between them I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered But if he is innocent who has done it Ah who I would call your attention very particularly to two points One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry Cooee before he knew that his son had returned Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends And now let us talk about George Meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow There was no rain as Holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless At nine oclock Lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool There is serious news this morning Lestrade observed It is said that Mr Turner of the Hall is so ill that his life is despaired of An elderly man I presume said Holmes About sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time This business has had a very bad effect upon him He was an old friend of McCarthys and I may add a great benefactor to him for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free Indeed That is interesting said Holmes Oh yes In a hundred other ways he has helped him Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him Really Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to Turner should still talk of marrying his son to Turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow It is the more strange since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea The daughter told us as much Do you not deduce something from that We have got to the deductions and the inferences said Lestrade winking at me I find it hard enough to tackle facts Holmes without flying away after theories and fancies You are right said Holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts Anyhow I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied Lestrade with some warmth And that is That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine Well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said Holmes laughing But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left Yes that is it It was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it We called at the door when the maid at Holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points Holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him His face flushed and darkened His brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter His face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool It was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side Sometimes Holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow Lestrade and I walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end The Boscombe Pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr Turner Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man To Holmes as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass He ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion What did you go into the pool for he asked I fished about with a rake I thought there might be some weapon or other trace But how on earth Oh tut tut I have no time That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place A mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds Oh how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it Here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body But here are three separate tracks of the same feet He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us These are young McCarthys feet Twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible That bears out his story He ran when he saw his father on the ground Then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down What is this then It is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening And this Ha ha What have we here Tiptoes tiptoes Square too quite unusual boots They come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak Now where did they come from He ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction For a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach A jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all traces were lost It has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran and perhaps write a little note Having done that we may drive back to our luncheon You may walk to the cab and I shall be with you presently It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood This may interest you Lestrade he remarked holding it out The murder was done with it I see no marks There are none How do you know then The grass was growing under it It had only lain there a few days There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken It corresponds with the injuries There is no sign of any other weapon And the murderer Is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes Indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket There are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search Lestrade laughed I am afraid that I am still a sceptic he said Theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded British jury Nous verrons answered Holmes calmly You work your own method and I shall work mine I shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to London by the evening train And leave your case unfinished No finished But the mystery It is solved Who was the criminal then The gentleman I describe But who is he Surely it would not be difficult to find out This is not such a populous neighbourhood Lestrade shrugged his shoulders I am a practical man he said and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a lefthanded gentleman with a game leg I should become the laughingstock of Scotland Yard All right said Holmes quietly I have given you the chance Here are your lodgings Goodbye I shall drop you a line before I leave Having left Lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position Look here Watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little I dont know quite what to do and I should value your advice Light a cigar and let me expound Pray do so Well now in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him One was the fact that his father should according to his account cry Cooee before seeing him The other was his singular dying reference to a rat He mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear Now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true What of this Cooee then Well obviously it could not have been meant for the son The son as far as he knew was in Bristol It was mere chance that he was within earshot The Cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with But Cooee is a distinctly Australian cry and one which is used between Australians There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia What of the rat then Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table This is a map of the Colony of Victoria he said I wired to Bristol for it last night He put his hand over part of the map What do you read ARAT I read And now He raised his hand BALLARAT Quite so That was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables He was trying to utter the name of his murderer So and so of Ballarat It is wonderful I exclaimed It is obvious And now you see I had narrowed the field down considerably The possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak Certainly And one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander Quite so Then comes our expedition of today By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade as to the personality of the criminal But how did you gain them You know my method It is founded upon the observation of trifles His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride His boots too might be told from their traces Yes they were peculiar boots But his lameness The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left He put less weight upon it Why Because he limpedhe was lame But his lefthandedness You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest The blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side Now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son He had even smoked there I found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar I have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco Having found the ash I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it It was an Indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam And the cigarholder I could see that the end had not been in his mouth Therefore he used a holder The tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so I deduced a blunt penknife Holmes I said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him I see the direction in which all this points The culprit is Mr John Turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure His slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character His tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease Pray sit down on the sofa said Holmes gently You had my note Yes the lodgekeeper brought it up You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall And why did you wish to see me He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered Yes said Holmes answering the look rather than the words It is so I know all about McCarthy The old man sank his face in his hands God help me he cried But I would not have let the young man come to harm I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes I am glad to hear you say so said Holmes gravely I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl It would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested It may not come to that said Holmes What I am no official agent I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and I am acting in her interests Young McCarthy must be got off however I am a dying man said old Turner I have had diabetes for years My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him Just tell us the truth he said I shall jot down the facts You will sign it and Watson here can witness it Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed Its as well said the old man its a question whether I shall live to the Assizes so it matters little to me but I should wish to spare Alice the shock And now I will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell You didnt know this dead man McCarthy He was a devil incarnate I tell you that God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he His grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life Ill tell you first how I came to be in his power It was in the early 60s at the diggings I was a young chap then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything I got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber There were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it There were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley Three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag I put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man McCarthy I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then but I spared him though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature We got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to England without being suspected There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life I bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and I set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which I had earned it I married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done In a word I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me I had gone up to town about an investment and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot Here we are Jack says he touching me on the arm well be as good as a family to you Theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us If you dontits a fine lawabiding country is England and theres always a policeman within hail Well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since There was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where I would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow It grew worse as Alice grew up for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police Whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was I gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which I could not give He asked for Alice His son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as I was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property But there I was firm I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that I had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough I stood firm McCarthy threatened I braved him to do his worst We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over When I went down there I found him talking with his son so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this Could I not snap the bond I was already a dying and a desperate man Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb I knew that my own fate was sealed But my memory and my girl Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue I did it Mr Holmes I would do it again Deeply as I have sinned I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast His cry brought back his son but I had gained the cover of the wood though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight That is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred Well it is not for me to judge you said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation I pray not sir And what do you intend to do In view of your health nothing You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes I will keep your confession and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it If not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us Farewell then said the old man solemnly Your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room God help us said Holmes after a long silence Why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxters words and say There but for the grace of God goes Sherlock Holmes James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past V THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years 82 and 90 I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave Some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate Some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him There is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up The year 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which I retain the records Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber of the Amateur Mendicant Society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case In the latter as may be remembered Sherlock Holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case All these I may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe It was in the latter days of September and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage As evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace crossindexing his records of crime while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russells fine seastories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves My wife was on a visit to her mothers and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street Why said I glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell Who could come tonight Some friend of yours perhaps Except yourself I have none he answered I do not encourage visitors A client then If so it is a serious case Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit Come in said he The man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety I owe you an apology he said raising his golden pincenez to his eyes I trust that I am not intruding I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber Give me your coat and umbrella said Holmes They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently You have come up from the southwest I see Yes from Horsham That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive I have come for advice That is easily got And help That is not always so easy I have heard of you Mr Holmes I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal Ah of course He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards He said that you could solve anything He said too much That you are never beaten I have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by a woman But what is that compared with the number of your successes It is true that I have been generally successful Then you may be so with me I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case It is no ordinary one None of those which come to me are I am the last court of appeal And yet I question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family You fill me with interest said Holmes Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze My name said he is John Openshaw but my own affairs have as far as I can understand little to do with this awful business It is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts I must go back to the commencement of the affair You must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle Elias and my father Joseph My father had a small factory at Coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida where he was reported to have done very well At the time of the war he fought in Jacksons army and afterwards under Hood where he rose to be a colonel When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex near Horsham He had made a very considerable fortune in the States and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them He was a singular man fierce and quicktempered very foulmouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition During all the years that he lived at Horsham I doubt if ever he set foot in the town He had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother He didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so This would be in the year 1878 after he had been eight or nine years in England He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy There was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumberroom up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter With a boys curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room One dayit was in March 1883a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate It was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort From India said he as he took it up Pondicherry postmark What can this be Opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate I began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face His lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand K K K he shrieked and then My God my God my sins have overtaken me What is it uncle I cried Death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter K three times repeated There was nothing else save the five dried pips What could be the reason of his overpowering terror I left the breakfasttable and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other They may do what they like but Ill checkmate them still said he with an oath Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room today and send down to Fordham the Horsham lawyer I did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room The fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it As I glanced at the box I noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope I wish you John said my uncle to witness my will I leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you If you can enjoy it in peace well and good If you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy I am sorry to give you such a twoedged thing but I cant say what turn things are going to take Kindly sign the paper where Mr Fordham shows you I signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him The singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives I could see a change in my uncle however He drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society Most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil When these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul At such times I have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin Well to come to an end of the matter Mr Holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back We found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden There was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide But I who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it The matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some 14000 which lay to his credit at the bank One moment Holmes interposed your statement is I foresee one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide The letter arrived on March 10 1883 His death was seven weeks later upon the night of May 2nd Thank you Pray proceed When my father took over the Horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up We found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed On the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of K K K repeated upon it and Letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath These we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw For the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in America Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the North Well it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at Horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the January of 85 On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable There he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one He had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself Why what on earth does this mean John he stammered My heart had turned to lead It is K K K said I He looked inside the envelope So it is he cried Here are the very letters But what is this written above them Put the papers on the sundial I read peeping over his shoulder What papers What sundial he asked The sundial in the garden There is no other said I but the papers must be those that are destroyed Pooh said he gripping hard at his courage We are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind Where does the thing come from From Dundee I answered glancing at the postmark Some preposterous practical joke said he What have I to do with sundials and papers I shall take no notice of such nonsense I should certainly speak to the police I said And be laughed at for my pains Nothing of the sort Then let me do so No I forbid you I wont have a fuss made about such nonsense It was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man I went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his Major Freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill I was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home In that however I was in error Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once My father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull I hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness He had as it appears been returning from Fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder There were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that I was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him In this sinister way I came into my inheritance You will ask me why I did not dispose of it I answer because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another It was in January 85 that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then During that time I have lived happily at Horsham and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation I had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips This is the envelope he continued The postmark is Londoneastern division Within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message K K K and then Put the papers on the sundial What have you done asked Holmes Nothing Nothing To tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white handsI have felt helpless I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against Tut tut cried Sherlock Holmes You must act man or you are lost Nothing but energy can save you This is no time for despair I have seen the police Ah But they listened to my story with a smile I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air Incredible imbecility he cried They have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me Has he come with you tonight No His orders were to stay in the house Again Holmes raved in the air Why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once I did not know It was only today that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you It is really two days since you had the letter We should have acted before this You have no further evidence I suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us There is one thing said John Openshaw He rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out upon the table I have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction Beyond the mention of pips I do not see that it helps us much I think myself that it is a page from some private diary The writing is undoubtedly my uncles Holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book It was headed March 1869 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices 4th Hudson came Same old platform 7th Set the pips on McCauley Paramore and John Swain of St Augustine 9th McCauley cleared 10th John Swain cleared 12th Visited Paramore All well Thank you said Holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor And now you must on no account lose another instant We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me You must get home instantly and act What shall I do There is but one thing to do It must be done at once You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them Having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed Do you understand Entirely Do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present I think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties I thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat You have given me fresh life and hope I shall certainly do as you advise Do not lose an instant And above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger How do you go back By train from Waterloo It is not yet nine The streets will be crowded so I trust that you may be in safety And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely I am armed That is well Tomorrow I shall set to work upon your case I shall see you at Horsham then No your secret lies in London It is there that I shall seek it Then I shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers I shall take your advice in every particular He shook hands with us and took his leave Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows This strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire Then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling I think Watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this Save perhaps the Sign of Four Well yes Save perhaps that And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos But have you I asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are There can be no question as to their nature he answered Then what are they Who is this K K K and why does he pursue this unhappy family Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together The ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses To carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopdias is a somewhat rare accomplishment It is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this I have endeavoured in my case to do If I remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion Yes I answered laughing It was a singular document Philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero I remember Botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco Those I think were the main points of my analysis Holmes grinned at the last item Well he said I say now as I said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it Now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopdia which stands upon the shelf beside you Thank you Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it In the first place we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America As to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors Did you remark the postmarks of those letters The first was from Pondicherry the second from Dundee and the third from London From East London What do you deduce from that They are all seaports That the writer was on board of a ship Excellent We have already a clue There can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship And now let us consider another point In the case of Pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in Dundee it was only some three or four days Does that suggest anything A greater distance to travel But the letter had also a greater distance to come Then I do not see the point There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter But as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer It is possible More than that It is probable And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why I urged young Openshaw to caution The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance But this one comes from London and therefore we cannot count upon delay Good God I cried What can it mean this relentless persecution The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury There must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination Their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may In this way you see K K K ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society But of what society Have you never said Sherlock Holmes bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan I never have Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee Here it is said he presently Ku Klux Klan A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle This terrible secret society was formed by some exConfederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in Tennessee Louisiana the Carolinas Georgia and Florida Its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country If he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner So perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South Eventually in the year 1869 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date You will observe said Holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers It may well have been cause and effect It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered Then the page we have seen Is such as we might expect It ran if I remember right sent the pips to A B and Cthat is sent the societys warning to them Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared or left the country and finally that C was visited with I fear a sinister result for C Well I think Doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him There is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men It had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down You will excuse me for not waiting for you said he I have I foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaws What steps will you take I asked It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries I may have to go down to Horsham after all You will not go there first No I shall commence with the City Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee As I waited I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart Holmes I cried you are too late Ah said he laying down his cup I feared as much How was it done He spoke calmly but I could see that he was deeply moved My eye caught the name of Openshaw and the heading Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge Here is the account Between nine and ten last night PoliceConstable Cook of the H Division on duty near Waterloo Bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water The night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it was quite impossible to effect a rescue The alarm however was given and by the aid of the waterpolice the body was eventually recovered It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was John Openshaw and whose residence is near Horsham It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats The body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages We sat in silence for some minutes Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him That hurts my pride Watson he said at last It is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride It becomes a personal matter with me now and if God sends me health I shall set my hand upon this gang That he should come to me for help and that I should send him away to his death He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands They must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last How could they have decoyed him down there The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station The bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose Well Watson we shall see who will win in the long run I am going out now To the police No I shall be my own police When I have spun the web they may take the flies but not before All day I was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet It was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn He walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water You are hungry I remarked Starving It had escaped my memory I have had nothing since breakfast Nothing Not a bite I had no time to think of it And how have you succeeded Well You have a clue I have them in the hollow of my hand Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged Why Watson let us put their own devilish trademark upon them It is well thought of What do you mean He took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope On the inside of the flap he wrote S H for J O Then he sealed it and addressed it to Captain James Calhoun Barque Lone Star Savannah Georgia That will await him when he enters port said he chuckling It may give him a sleepless night He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him And who is this Captain Calhoun The leader of the gang I shall have the others but he first How did you trace it then He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names I have spent the whole day said he over Lloyds registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in 83 There were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months Of these one the Lone Star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from London the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union Texas I think I was not and am not sure which but I knew that the ship must have an American origin What then I searched the Dundee records and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January 85 my suspicion became a certainty I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London Yes The Lone Star had arrived here last week I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to Savannah I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight What will you do then Oh I have my hand upon him He and the two mates are as I learn the only nativeborn Americans in the ship The others are Finns and Germans I know also that they were all three away from the ship last night I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo By the time that their sailingship reaches Savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder There is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah but none ever reached us We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters L S carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star VI THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP Isa Whitney brother of the late Elias Whitney DD Principal of the Theological College of St Georges was much addicted to opium The habit grew upon him as I understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read De Quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects He found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives I can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man One nightit was in June 89there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock I sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment A patient said she Youll have to go out I groaned for I was newly come back from a weary day We heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum Our own door flew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured stuff with a black veil entered the room You will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder Oh Im in such trouble she cried I do so want a little help Why said my wife pulling up her veil it is Kate Whitney How you startled me Kate I had not an idea who you were when you came in I didnt know what to do so I came straight to you That was always the way Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse It was very sweet of you to come Now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed Oh no no I want the doctors advice and help too Its about Isa He has not been home for two days I am so frightened about him It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find Did she know where her husband was Was it possible that we could bring him back to her It seems that it was She had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening But now the spell had been upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects There he was to be found she was sure of it at the Bar of Gold in Upper Swandam Lane But what was she to do How could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him There was the case and of course there was but one way out of it Might I not escort her to this place And then as a second thought why should she come at all I was Isa Whitneys medical adviser and as such I had influence over him I could manage it better if I were alone I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge Between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave I found the den of which I was in search Ordering my cab to wait I passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oillamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes The most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a threelegged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire As I entered a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth Thank you I have not come to stay said I There is a friend of mine here Mr Isa Whitney and I wish to speak with him There was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom I saw Whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me My God Its Watson said he He was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter I say Watson what oclock is it Nearly eleven Of what day Of Friday June 19th Good heavens I thought it was Wednesday It is Wednesday What dyou want to frighten a chap for He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key I tell you that it is Friday man Your wife has been waiting this two days for you You should be ashamed of yourself So I am But youve got mixed Watson for I have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipesI forget how many But Ill go home with you I wouldnt frighten Katepoor little Kate Give me your hand Have you a cab Yes I have one waiting Then I shall go in it But I must owe something Find what I owe Watson I am all off colour I can do nothing for myself I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered Walk past me and then look back at me The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear I glanced down They could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers I took two steps forward and looked back It took all my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment He had turned his back so that none could see him but I His form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than Sherlock Holmes He made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering looselipped senility Holmes I whispered what on earth are you doing in this den As low as you can he answered I have excellent ears If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you I have a cab outside Then pray send him home in it You may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me If you will wait outside I shall be with you in five minutes It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery I felt however that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence In a few minutes I had written my note paid Whitneys bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot Then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter I suppose Watson said he that you imagine that I have added opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views I was certainly surprised to find you there But not more so than I to find you I came to find a friend And I to find an enemy An enemy Yes one of my natural enemies or shall I say my natural prey Briefly Watson I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as I have done before now Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase for I have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me There is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of Pauls Wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights What You do not mean bodies Ay bodies Watson We should be rich men if we had 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den It is the vilest murdertrap on the whole riverside and I fear that Neville St Clair has entered it never to leave it more But our trap should be here He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs Now Watson said Holmes as a tall dogcart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns Youll come with me wont you If I can be of use Oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so My room at The Cedars is a doublebedded one The Cedars Yes that is Mr St Clairs house I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry Where is it then Near Lee in Kent We have a sevenmile drive before us But I am all in the dark Of course you are Youll know all about it presently Jump up here All right John we shall not need you Heres half a crown Look out for me tomorrow about eleven Give her her head So long then He flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds Holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while I sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts We had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best You have a grand gift of silence Watson said he It makes you quite invaluable as a companion Pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not overpleasant I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman tonight when she meets me at the door You forget that I know nothing about it I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee It seems absurdly simple and yet somehow I can get nothing to go upon Theres plenty of thread no doubt but I cant get the end of it into my hand Now Ill state the case clearly and concisely to you Watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me Proceed then Some years agoto be definite in May 1884there came to Lee a gentleman Neville St Clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money He took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children He had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the 514 from Cannon Street every night Mr St Clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him I may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to 88 10s while he has 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank There is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind Last Monday Mr Neville St Clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks Now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company Now if you are well up in your London you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane where you found me tonight Mrs St Clair had her lunch started for the City did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly 435 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station Have you followed me so far It is very clear If you remember Monday was an exceedingly hot day and Mrs St Clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window The window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated He waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie Convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor At the foot of the stairs however she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a Dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat The inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which Mr St Clair had last been seen There was no sign of him there In fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that Mrs St Clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it Out there fell a cascade of childrens bricks It was the toy which he had promised to bring home This discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious The rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime The front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr Neville St Clair with the exception of his coat His boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of Mr Neville St Clair Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by Mrs St Clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime His defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes So much for the Lascar manager Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St Clair His name is Hugh Boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City He is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas Some little distance down Threadneedle Street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time His appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him A shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest But a cripple said I What could he have done singlehanded against a man in the prime of life He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man Surely your medical experience would tell you Watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others Pray continue your narrative Mrs St Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations Inspector Barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him There were it is true some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr Neville St Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police As to Mrs St Clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming He was removed loudly protesting to the policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue And it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had feared to find It was Neville St Clairs coat and not Neville St Clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded And what do you think they found in the pockets I cannot imagine No I dont think you would guess Every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies421 pennies and 270 halfpennies It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide But a human body is a different matter There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room Would the body be dressed in a coat alone No sir but the facts might be met speciously enough Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St Clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed What would he do then It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments He would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink He has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street There is not an instant to be lost He rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking He throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared It certainly sounds feasible Well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better Boone as I have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him He had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one There the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat Neville St Clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearanceare all as far from a solution as ever I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us Just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows We are on the outskirts of Lee said my companion We have touched on three English counties in our short drive starting in Middlesex passing over an angle of Surrey and ending in Kent See that light among the trees That is The Cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already I have little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street I asked Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here Mrs St Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague I hate to meet her Watson when I have no news of her husband Here we are Whoa there whoa We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds A stableboy had run out to the horses head and springing down I followed Holmes up the small winding graveldrive which led to the house As we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question Well she cried well And then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders No good news None No bad No Thank God for that But come in You must be weary for you have had a long day This is my friend Dr Watson He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation I am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly You will I am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us My dear madam said I I am an old campaigner and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed If I can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here I shall be indeed happy Now Mr Sherlock Holmes said the lady as we entered a welllit diningroom upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which I beg that you will give a plain answer Certainly madam Do not trouble about my feelings I am not hysterical nor given to fainting I simply wish to hear your real real opinion Upon what point In your heart of hearts do you think that Neville is alive Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question Frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basketchair Frankly then madam I do not You think that he is dead I do Murdered I dont say that Perhaps And on what day did he meet his death On Monday Then perhaps Mr Holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him today Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised What he roared Yes today She stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air May I see it Certainly He snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight Coarse writing murmured Holmes Surely this is not your husbands writing madam No but the enclosure is I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address How can you tell that The name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself The rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has been used If it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade This man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it It is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles Let us now see the letter Ha there has been an enclosure here Yes there was a ring His signetring And you are sure that this is your husbands hand One of his hands One His hand when he wrote hurriedly It is very unlike his usual writing and yet I know it well Dearest do not be frightened All will come well There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify Wait in patienceNEVILLE Written in pencil upon the flyleaf of a book octavo size no watermark Hum Posted today in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb Ha And the flap has been gummed if I am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco And you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam None Neville wrote those words And they were posted today at Gravesend Well Mrs St Clair the clouds lighten though I should not venture to say that the danger is over But he must be alive Mr Holmes Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent The ring after all proves nothing It may have been taken from him No no it is it is his very own writing Very well It may however have been written on Monday and only posted today That is possible If so much may have happened between Oh you must not discourage me Mr Holmes I know that all is well with him There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet I in the diningroom rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view But if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you I cannot imagine It is unthinkable And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you No And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane Very much so Was the window open Yes Then he might have called to you He might He only as I understand gave an inarticulate cry Yes A call for help you thought Yes He waved his hands But it might have been a cry of surprise Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands It is possible And you thought he was pulled back He disappeared so suddenly He might have leaped back You did not see anyone else in the room No but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs Quite so Your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on But without his collar or tie I distinctly saw his bare throat Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane Never Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium Never Thank you Mrs St Clair Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear We shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow A large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our disposal and I was quickly between the sheets for I was weary after my night of adventure Sherlock Holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an allnight sitting He took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressinggown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strongset aquiline features So he sat as I dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment The pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night Awake Watson he asked Yes Game for a morning drive Certainly Then dress No one is stirring yet but I know where the stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out He chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night As I dressed I glanced at my watch It was no wonder that no one was stirring It was twentyfive minutes past four I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse I want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots I think Watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross But I think I have the key of the affair now And where is it I asked smiling In the bathroom he answered Oh yes I am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity I have just been there and I have taken it out and I have got it in this Gladstone bag Come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine In the road stood our horse and trap with the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head We both sprang in and away we dashed down the London Road A few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream It has been in some points a singular case said Holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop I confess that I have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him One of them held the horses head while the other led us in Who is on duty asked Holmes Inspector Bradstreet sir Ah Bradstreet how are you A tall stout official had come down the stoneflagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket I wish to have a quiet word with you Bradstreet Certainly Mr Holmes Step into my room here It was a small officelike room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall The inspector sat down at his desk What can I do for you Mr Holmes I called about that beggarman Boonethe one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr Neville St Clair of Lee Yes He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries So I heard You have him here In the cells Is he quiet Oh he gives no trouble But he is a dirty scoundrel Dirty Yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers Well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and I think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it I should like to see him very much Would you That is easily done Come this way You can leave your bag No I think that Ill take it Very good Come this way if you please He led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side The third on the right is his said the inspector Here it is He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through He is asleep said he You can see him very well We both put our eyes to the grating The prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily He was a middlesized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat He was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead Hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector He certainly needs a wash remarked Holmes I had an idea that he might and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bathsponge He he You are a funny one chuckled the inspector Now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure Well I dont know why not said the inspector He doesnt look a credit to the Bow Street cells does he He slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell The sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber Holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoners face Let me introduce you he shouted to Mr Neville St Clair of Lee in the county of Kent Never in my life have I seen such a sight The mans face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree Gone was the coarse brown tint Gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face A twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment Then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow Great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man I know him from the photograph The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny Be it so said he And pray what am I charged with With making away with Mr Neville St Oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin Well I have been twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake If I am Mr Neville St Clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore I am illegally detained No crime but a very great error has been committed said Holmes You would have done better to have trusted your wife It was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner God help me I would not have them ashamed of their father My God What an exposure What can I do Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity On the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers Inspector Bradstreet would I am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities The case would then never go into court at all God bless you cried the prisoner passionately I would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children You are the first who have ever heard my story My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield where I received an excellent education I travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and I volunteered to supply them There was the point from which all my adventures started It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles When an actor I had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill I took advantage now of my attainments I painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of fleshcoloured plaster Then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress I took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar For seven hours I plied my trade and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s 4d I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 I was at my wits end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me I begged a fortnights grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt Well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still It was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers Only one man knew my secret He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a welldressed man about town This fellow a Lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession Well very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 a yearwhich is less than my average takingsbut I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City All day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 As I grew richer I grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation My dear wife knew that I had business in the City She little knew what Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me I gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the Lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me I heard her voice downstairs but I knew that she could not ascend Swiftly I threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig Even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me I threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning Then I seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings I hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the Thames The other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after I found rather I confess to my relief that instead of being identified as Mr Neville St Clair I was arrested as his murderer I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear That note only reached her yesterday said Holmes Good God What a week she must have spent The police have watched this Lascar said Inspector Bradstreet and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days That was it said Holmes nodding approvingly I have no doubt of it But have you never been prosecuted for begging Many times but what was a fine to me It must stop here however said Bradstreet If the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of Hugh Boone I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken But if you are found again then all must come out I am sure Mr Holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up I wish I knew how you reach your results I reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag I think Watson that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast VII THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand Beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination You are engaged said I perhaps I interrupt you Not at all I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results The matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals I suppose I remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime No no No crime said Sherlock Holmes laughing Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal We have already had experience of such So much so I remarked that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime Precisely You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip Well I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category You know Peterson the commissionaire Yes It is to him that this trophy belongs It is his hat No no he found it Its owner is unknown I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem And first as to how it came here It arrived upon Christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is I have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of Petersons fire The facts are these about four oclock on Christmas morning Peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road In front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder As he reached the corner of Goodge Street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs One of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose Which surely he restored to their owner My dear fellow there lies the problem It is true that For Mrs Henry Baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials H B are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of Bakers and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them What then did Peterson do He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me The goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay Its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner Did he not advertise No Then what clue could you have as to his identity Only as much as we can deduce From his hat Precisely But you are joking What can you gather from this old battered felt Here is my lens You know my methods What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear The lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured There was no makers name but as Holmes had remarked the initials H B were scrawled upon one side It was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing For the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink I can see nothing said I handing it back to my friend On the contrary Watson you can see everything You fail however to reason from what you see You are too timid in drawing your inferences Then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days He had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him My dear Holmes He has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance He is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat Also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house You are certainly joking Holmes Not in the least Is it possible that even now when I give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained I have no doubt that I am very stupid but I must confess that I am unable to follow you For example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose It is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it The decline of his fortunes then This hat is three years old These flat brims curled at the edge came in then It is a hat of the very best quality Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world Well that is clear enough certainly But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression Sherlock Holmes laughed Here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer They are never sold upon hats If this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature On the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect Your reasoning is certainly plausible The further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining The lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber They all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream This dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training But his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him This hat has not been brushed for weeks When I see you my dear Watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection But he might be a bachelor Nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife Remember the card upon the birds leg You have an answer to everything But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house One tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when I see no less than five I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other Anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet Are you satisfied Well it is very ingenious said I laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and Peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment The goose Mr Holmes The goose sir he gasped Eh What of it then Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face See here sir See what my wife found in its crop He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle By Jove Peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed I suppose you know what you have got A diamond sir A precious stone It cuts into glass as though it were putty Its more than a precious stone It is the precious stone Not the Countess of Morcars blue carbuncle I ejaculated Precisely so I ought to know its size and shape seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately It is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price A thousand pounds Great Lord of mercy The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us That is the reward and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem It was lost if I remember aright at the Hotel Cosmopolitan I remarked Precisely so on December 22nd just five days ago John Horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewelcase The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes I have some account of the matter here I believe He rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery John Horner 26 plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle James Ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressingroom of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose He had remained with Horner some little time but had finally been called away On returning he found that Horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable Ryder instantly gave the alarm and Horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms Catherine Cusack maid to the Countess deposed to having heard Ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness Inspector Bradstreet B division gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the Assizes Horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court Hum So much for the policecourt said Holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other You see Watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect Here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from Mr Henry Baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery To do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers If this fail I shall have recourse to other methods What will you say Give me a pencil and that slip of paper Now then Found at the corner of Goodge Street a goose and a black felt hat Mr Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 630 this evening at 221B Baker Street That is clear and concise Very But will he see it Well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird Then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it Here you are Peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers In which sir Oh in the Globe Star Pall Mall St Jamess Gazette Evening News Standard Echo and any others that occur to you Very well sir And this stone Ah yes I shall keep the stone Thank you And I say Peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring When the commissionaire had gone Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light Its a bonny thing said he Just see how it glints and sparkles Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime Every good stone is They are the devils pet baits In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed This stone is not yet twenty years old It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red In spite of its youth it has already a sinister history There have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison Ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it Do you think that this man Horner is innocent I cannot tell Well then do you imagine that this other one Henry Baker had anything to do with the matter It is I think much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold That however I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement And you can do nothing until then Nothing In that case I shall continue my professional round But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business Very glad to see you I dine at seven There is a woodcock I believe By the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps I ought to ask Mrs Hudson to examine its crop I had been delayed at a case and it was a little after halfpast six when I found myself in Baker Street once more As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight Just as I arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to Holmes room Mr Henry Baker I believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume Pray take this chair by the fire Mr Baker It is a cold night and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter Ah Watson you have just come at the right time Is that your hat Mr Baker Yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat He was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown A touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled Holmes surmise as to his habits His rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt He spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune We have retained these things for some days said Holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them Very naturally By the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it To eat it Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement Yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well Oh certainly certainly answered Mr Baker with a sigh of relief Of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish The man burst into a hearty laugh They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me No sir I think that with your permission I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders There is your hat then and there your bird said he By the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from I am somewhat of a fowl fancier and I have seldom seen a better grown goose Certainly sir said Baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn near the Museumwe are to be found in the Museum itself during the day you understand This year our good host Windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at Christmas My pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you I am much indebted to you sir for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way So much for Mr Henry Baker said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter Are you hungry Watson Not particularly Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot By all means It was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats Outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter Wimpole Street Harley Street and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn which is a small publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he My geese The man seemed surprised Yes I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr Henry Baker who was a member of your goose club Ah yes I see But you see sir thems not our geese Indeed Whose then Well I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden Indeed I know some of them Which was it Breckinridge is his name Ah I dont know him Well heres your good health landlord and prosperity to your house Goodnight Now for Mr Breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air Remember Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands Let us follow it out to the bitter end Faces to the south then and quick march We passed across Holborn down Endell Street and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horseylooking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters Goodevening Its a cold night said Holmes The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion Sold out of geese I see continued Holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble Let you have five hundred tomorrow morning Thats no good Well there are some on the stall with the gasflare Ah but I was recommended to you Who by The landlord of the Alpha Oh yes I sent him a couple of dozen Fine birds they were too Now where did you get them from To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman Now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at Lets have it straight now It is straight enough I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha Well then I shant tell you So now Oh it is a matter of no importance but I dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle Warm Youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as I am When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its Where are the geese and Who did you sell the geese to and What will you take for the geese One would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them Well I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said Holmes carelessly If you wont tell us the bet is off that is all But Im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred Well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman Its nothing of the kind I say it is I dont believe it Dyou think you know more about fowls than I who have handled them ever since I was a nipper I tell you all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred Youll never persuade me to believe that Will you bet then Its merely taking your money for I know that I am right But Ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate The salesman chuckled grimly Bring me the books Bill said he The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp Now then Mr Cocksure said the salesman I thought that I was out of geese but before I finish youll find that there is still one left in my shop You see this little book Well Thats the list of the folk from whom I buy Dyou see Well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger Now then You see this other page in red ink Well that is a list of my town suppliers Now look at that third name Just read it out to me Mrs Oakshott 117 Brixton Road249 read Holmes Quite so Now turn that up in the ledger Holmes turned to the page indicated Here you are Mrs Oakshott 117 Brixton Road egg and poultry supplier Now then whats the last entry December 22nd Twentyfour geese at 7s 6d Quite so There you are And underneath Sold to Mr Windigate of the Alpha at 12s What have you to say now Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words A few yards off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the Pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he I daresay that if I had put 100 down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager Well Watson we are I fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs Oakshott tonight or whether we should reserve it for tomorrow It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and I should His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left Turning round we saw a little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while Breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure Ive had enough of you and your geese he shouted I wish you were all at the devil together If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk Ill set the dog at you You bring Mrs Oakshott here and Ill answer her but what have you to do with it Did I buy the geese off you No but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man Well then ask Mrs Oakshott for it She told me to ask you Well you can ask the King of Proosia for all I care Ive had enough of it Get out of this He rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness Ha this may save us a visit to Brixton Road whispered Holmes Come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder He sprang round and I could see in the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face Who are you then What do you want he asked in a quavering voice You will excuse me said Holmes blandly but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now I think that I could be of assistance to you You Who are you How could you know anything of the matter My name is Sherlock Holmes It is my business to know what other people dont know But you can know nothing of this Excuse me I know everything of it You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs Oakshott of Brixton Road to a salesman named Breckinridge by him in turn to Mr Windigate of the Alpha and by him to his club of which Mr Henry Baker is a member Oh sir you are the very man whom I have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter Sherlock Holmes hailed a fourwheeler which was passing In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this windswept marketplace said he But pray tell me before we go farther who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting The man hesitated for an instant My name is John Robinson he answered with a sidelong glance No no the real name said Holmes sweetly It is always awkward doing business with an alias A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger Well then said he my real name is James Ryder Precisely so Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan Pray step into the cab and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe Then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sittingroom at Baker Street Nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him Here we are said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room The fire looks very seasonable in this weather You look cold Mr Ryder Pray take the basketchair I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours Now then You want to know what became of those geese Yes sir Or rather I fancy of that goose It was one bird I imagine in which you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail Ryder quivered with emotion Oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to It came here Here Yes and a most remarkable bird it proved I dont wonder that you should take an interest in it It laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen I have it here in my museum Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand Holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant manypointed radiance Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it The games up Ryder said Holmes quietly Hold up man or youll be into the fire Give him an arm back into his chair Watson Hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity Give him a dash of brandy So Now he looks a little more human What a shrimp it is to be sure For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser I have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which I could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me Still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete You had heard Ryder of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcars It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice I seeher ladyships waitingmaid Well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used It seems to me Ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you You knew that this man Horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him What did you do then You made some small job in my ladys roomyou and your confederate Cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for Then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested You then Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees For Gods sake have mercy he shrieked Think of my father Of my mother It would break their hearts I never went wrong before I never will again I swear it Ill swear it on a Bible Oh dont bring it into court For Christs sake dont Get back into your chair said Holmes sternly It is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing I will fly Mr Holmes I will leave the country sir Then the charge against him will break down Hum We will talk about that And now let us hear a true account of the next act How came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market Tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips I will tell you it just as it happened sir said he When Horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe I went out as if on some commission and I made for my sisters house She had married a man named Oakshott and lived in Brixton Road where she fattened fowls for the market All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road My sister asked me what was the matter and why I was so pale but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do I had a friend once called Maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in Pentonville One day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole I knew that he would be true to me for I knew one or two things about him so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence He would show me how to turn the stone into money But how to get to him in safety I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel I might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present and I knew that she was always as good as her word I would take my goose now and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn There was a little shed in the yard and behind this I drove one of the birdsa fine big one white with a barred tail I caught it and prying its bill open I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach The bird gave a gulp and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop But the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others Whatever were you doing with that bird Jem says she Well said I you said youd give me one for Christmas and I was feeling which was the fattest Oh says she weve set yours aside for youJems bird we call it Its the big white one over yonder Theres twentysix of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market Thank you Maggie says I but if it is all the same to you Id rather have that one I was handling just now The other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you Never mind Ill have the other and Ill take it now said I Oh just as you like said she a little huffed Which is it you want then That white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock Oh very well Kill it and take it with you Well I did what she said Mr Holmes and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn I told my pal what I had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to He laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose My heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred I left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard There was not a bird to be seen there Where are they all Maggie I cried Gone to the dealers Jem Which dealers Breckinridge of Covent Garden But was there another with a barred tail I asked the same as the one I chose Yes Jem there were two barredtailed ones and I could never tell them apart Well then of course I saw it all and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone You heard him yourselves tonight Well he has always answered me like that My sister thinks that I am going mad Sometimes I think that I am myself And nowand now I am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character God help me God help me He burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands There was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes fingertips upon the edge of the table Then my friend rose and threw open the door Get out said he What sir Oh Heaven bless you No more words Get out And no more words were needed There was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street After all Watson said Holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies If Horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse I suppose that I am commuting a felony but it is just possible that I am saving a soul This fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened Send him to gaol now and you make him a gaolbird for life Besides it is the season of forgiveness Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward If you will have the goodness to touch the bell Doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature VIII THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes I find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic Of all these varied cases however I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the wellknown Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth It was early in April in the year 83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed He was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarterpast seven I blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for I was myself regular in my habits Very sorry to knock you up Watson said he but its the common lot this morning Mrs Hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and I on you What is it thena fire No a client It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me She is waiting now in the sittingroom Now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate Should it prove to be an interesting case you would I am sure wish to follow it from the outset I thought at any rate that I should call you and give you the chance My dear fellow I would not miss it for anything I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered Goodmorning madam said Holmes cheerily My name is Sherlock Holmes This is my intimate friend and associate Dr Watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself Ha I am glad to see that Mrs Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire Pray draw up to it and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee for I observe that you are shivering It is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested What then It is fear Mr Holmes It is terror She raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick allcomprehensive glances You must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm We shall soon set matters right I have no doubt You have come in by train this morning I see You know me then No but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove You must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the station The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion There is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places The marks are perfectly fresh There is no vehicle save a dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the lefthand side of the driver Whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she I started from home before six reached Leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to Waterloo Sir I can stand this strain no longer I shall go mad if it continues I have no one to turn tonone save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid I have heard of you Mr Holmes I have heard of you from Mrs Farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need It was from her that I had your address Oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks I shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful Holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small casebook which he consulted Farintosh said he Ah yes I recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara I think it was before your time Watson I can only say madam that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend As to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to at the time which suits you best And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter Alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman He does not say so but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes But I have heard Mr Holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me I am all attention madam My name is Helen Stoner and I am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England the Roylotts of Stoke Moran on the western border of Surrey Holmes nodded his head The name is familiar to me said he The family was at one time among the richest in England and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north and Hampshire in the west In the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency Nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage The last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice In a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence As it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man When Dr Roylott was in India he married my mother Mrs Stoner the young widow of MajorGeneral Stoner of the Bengal Artillery My sister Julia and I were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mothers remarriage She had a considerable sum of moneynot less than 1000 a yearand this she bequeathed to Dr Roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage Shortly after our return to England my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe Dr Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfathers case it had I believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics A series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end He has a passion also for Indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives No servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house She was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has Your sister is dead then She died just two years ago and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you You can understand that living the life which I have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position We had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister Miss Honoria Westphail who lives near Harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house Julia went there at Christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor Pray be precise as to details said he It is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory The manorhouse is as I have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings Of these bedrooms the first is Dr Roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own There is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor Do I make myself plain Perfectly so The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn That fatal night Dr Roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke She left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding At eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back Tell me Helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night Never said I I suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep Certainly not But why Because during the last few nights I have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle I am a light sleeper and it has awakened me I cannot tell where it came fromperhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it No I have not It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation Very likely And yet if it were on the lawn I wonder that you did not hear it also Ah but I sleep more heavily than you Well it is of no great consequence at any rate She smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock Indeed said Holmes Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night Always And why I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked Quite so Pray proceed with your statement I could not sleep that night A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me My sister and I you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied It was a wild night The wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows Suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman I knew that it was my sisters voice I sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen As I ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges I stared at it horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it By the light of the corridorlamp I saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard I ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground She writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed At first I thought that she had not recognised me but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget Oh my God Helen It was the band The speckled band There was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words I rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and I met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown When he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister One moment said Holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound Could you swear to it That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry It is my strong impression that I heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house I may possibly have been deceived Was your sister dressed No she was in her nightdress In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place That is important And what conclusions did the coroner come to He investigated the case with great care for Dr Roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night The walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result The chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples It is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end Besides there were no marks of any violence upon her How about poison The doctors examined her for it but without success What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time Yes there are nearly always some there Ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled band Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied These are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative Two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever A month ago however a dear friend whom I have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage His name is ArmitagePercy Armitagethe second son of Mr Armitage of Crane Water near Reading My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept Imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as I lay awake thinking over her terrible fate I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death I sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room I was too shaken to go to bed again however so I dressed and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down got a dogcart at the Crown Inn which is opposite and drove to Leatherhead from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice You have done wisely said my friend But have you told me all Yes all Miss Roylott you have not You are screening your stepfather Why what do you mean For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee Five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist You have been cruelly used said Holmes The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist He is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength There was a long silence during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire This is a very deep business he said at last There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action Yet we have not a moment to lose If we were to come to Stoke Moran today would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather As it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most important business It is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you We have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and I could easily get her out of the way Excellent You are not averse to this trip Watson By no means Then we shall both come What are you going to do yourself I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town But I shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming And you may expect us early in the afternoon I have myself some small business matters to attend to Will you not wait and breakfast No I must go My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room And what do you think of it all Watson asked Sherlock Holmes leaning back in his chair It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business Dark enough and sinister enough Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end What becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman I cannot think When you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines But what then did the gipsies do I cannot imagine I see many objections to any such theory And so do I It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day I want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away But what in the name of the devil The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side A large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey Which of you is Holmes asked this apparition My name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly I am Dr Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran Indeed Doctor said Holmes blandly Pray take a seat I will do nothing of the kind My stepdaughter has been here I have traced her What has she been saying to you It is a little cold for the time of the year said Holmes What has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously But I have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably Ha You put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his huntingcrop I know you you scoundrel I have heard of you before You are Holmes the meddler My friend smiled Holmes the busybody His smile broadened Holmes the Scotland Yard Jackinoffice Holmes chuckled heartily Your conversation is most entertaining said he When you go out close the door for there is a decided draught I will go when I have had my say Dont you dare to meddle with my affairs I know that Miss Stoner has been here I traced her I am a dangerous man to fall foul of See here He stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands See that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room He seems a very amiable person said Holmes laughing I am not quite so bulky but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force This incident gives zest to our investigation however and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her And now Watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors Commons where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter It was nearly one oclock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures I have seen the will of the deceased wife said he To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned The total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of 1100 is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than 750 Each daughter can claim an income of 250 in case of marriage It is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent My mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort And now Watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket An Eleys No 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots That and a toothbrush are I think all that we need At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes It was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged My companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought Suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows Look there said he A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion Stoke Moran said he Yes sir that be the house of Dr Grimesby Roylott remarked the driver There is some building going on there said Holmes that is where we are going Theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields There it is where the lady is walking And the lady I fancy is Miss Stoner observed Holmes shading his eyes Yes I think we had better do as you suggest We got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead I thought it as well said Holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business It may stop his gossip Goodafternoon Miss Stoner You see that we have been as good as our word Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy I have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly All has turned out splendidly Dr Roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening We have had the pleasure of making the Doctors acquaintance said Holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened Good heavens she cried he has followed me then So it appears He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him What will he say when he returns He must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track You must lock yourself up from him tonight If he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at Harrow Now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine The building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin The central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit Holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows This I take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to Dr Roylotts chamber Exactly so But I am now sleeping in the middle one Pending the alterations as I understand By the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall There were none I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room Ah that is suggestive Now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open There are windows in it of course Yes but very small ones Too narrow for anyone to pass through As you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side Now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters Miss Stoner did so and Holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar Then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry Hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted Well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened Holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate It was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window These articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment Where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow It goes to the housekeepers room It looks newer than the other things Yes it was only put there a couple of years ago Your sister asked for it I suppose No I never heard of her using it We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves Indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bellpull there You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards Then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall Finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug Why its a dummy said he Wont it ring No it is not even attached to a wire This is very interesting You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is How very absurd I never noticed that before Very strange muttered Holmes pulling at the rope There are one or two very singular points about this room For example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air That is also quite modern said the lady Done about the same time as the bellrope remarked Holmes Yes there were several little changes carried out about that time They seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate With your permission Miss Stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment Dr Grimesby Roylotts chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished A campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest Whats in here he asked tapping the safe My stepfathers business papers Oh you have seen inside then Only once some years ago I remember that it was full of papers There isnt a cat in it for example No What a strange idea Well look at this He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it No we dont keep a cat But there is a cheetah and a baboon Ah yes of course Well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants I daresay There is one point which I should wish to determine He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention Thank you That is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket Hullo Here is something interesting The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed The lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord What do you make of that Watson Its a common enough lash But I dont know why it should be tied That is not quite so common is it Ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all I think that I have seen enough now Miss Stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn I had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation We had walked several times up and down the lawn neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie It is very essential Miss Stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect I shall most certainly do so The matter is too serious for any hesitation Your life may depend upon your compliance I assure you that I am in your hands In the first place both my friend and I must spend the night in your room Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment Yes it must be so Let me explain I believe that that is the village inn over there Yes that is the Crown Very good Your windows would be visible from there Certainly You must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back Then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy I have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night Oh yes easily The rest you will leave in our hands But what will you do We shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you I believe Mr Holmes that you have already made up your mind said Miss Stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve Perhaps I have Then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright No I do not think so I think that there was probably some more tangible cause And now Miss Stoner we must leave you for if Dr Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain Goodbye and be brave for if you will do what I have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom at the Crown Inn They were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House At dusk we saw Dr Grimesby Roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him The trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms Do you know Watson said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness I have really some scruples as to taking you tonight There is a distinct element of danger Can I be of assistance Your presence might be invaluable Then I shall certainly come It is very kind of you You speak of danger You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me No but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more I imagine that you saw all that I did I saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine You saw the ventilator too Yes but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran My dear Holmes Oh yes I did You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr Roylotts cigar Now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms It could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry I deduced a ventilator But what harm can there be in that Well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates A ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies Does not that strike you I cannot as yet see any connection Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed No It was clamped to the floor Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before I cannot say that I have The lady could not move her bed It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull Holmes I cried I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime Subtle enough and horrible enough When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals He has nerve and he has knowledge Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession This man strikes even deeper but I think Watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful About nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House Two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us That is our signal said Holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there A moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand There was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall Making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness My God I whispered did you see it Holmes was for the moment as startled as I His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear It is a nice household he murmured That is the baboon I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected There was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment I confess that I felt easier in my mind when after following Holmes example and slipping off my shoes I found myself inside the bedroom My companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room All was as we had seen it in the daytime Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words The least sound would be fatal to our plans I nodded to show that I had heard We must sit without light He would see it through the ventilator I nodded again Do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it Have your pistol ready in case we should need it I will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table Holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle Then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil I could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet I knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself The shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness From outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour How long they seemed those quarters Twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal Someone in the next room had lit a darklantern I heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger For half an hour I sat with straining ears Then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle The instant that we heard it Holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull You see it Watson he yelled You see it But I saw nothing At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely I could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened It swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek They say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds It struck cold to our hearts and I stood gazing at Holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose What can it mean I gasped It means that it is all over Holmes answered And perhaps after all it is for the best Take your pistol and we will enter Dr Roylotts room With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within Then he turned the handle and entered I at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand It was a singular sight which met our eyes On the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar Beside this table on the wooden chair sat Dr Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head As we entered he made neither sound nor motion The band the speckled band whispered Holmes I took a step forward In an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent It is a swamp adder cried Holmes the deadliest snake in India He has died within ten seconds of being bitten Violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another Let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened As he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it Such are the true facts of the death of Dr Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day I had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear Watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data The presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door My attention was speedily drawn as I have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed The discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India I felt that I was probably on the right track The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage It would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work Then I thought of the whistle Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim He had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed It might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator The sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant Having once made up my mind you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also and I instantly lit the light and attacked it With the result of driving it through the ventilator And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr Grimesby Roylotts death and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience IX THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEERS THUMB Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his noticethat of Mr Hatherleys thumb and that of Colonel Warburtons madness Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results The story has I believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect It was in the summer of 89 not long after my marriage that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us My practice had steadily increased and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station I got a few patients from among the officials One of these whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence One morning at a little before seven oclock I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom I dressed hurriedly for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs As I descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him Ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder hes all right What is it then I asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room Its a new patient he whispered I thought Id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away There he is all safe and sound I must go now Doctor I have my dooties just the same as you And off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him I entered my consultingroom and found a gentleman seated by the table He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains He was young not more than fiveandtwenty I should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control I am sorry to knock you up so early Doctor said he but I have had a very serious accident during the night I came in by train this morning and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here I gave the maid a card but I see that she has left it upon the sidetable I took it up and glanced at it Mr Victor Hatherley hydraulic engineer 16A Victoria Street 3rd floor That was the name style and abode of my morning visitor I regret that I have kept you waiting said I sitting down in my librarychair You are fresh from a night journey I understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation Oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed He laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh Stop it I cried pull yourself together and I poured out some water from a caraffe It was useless however He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone Presently he came to himself once more very weary and palelooking I have been making a fool of myself he gasped Not at all Drink this I dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks Thats better said he And now Doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots Good heavens I cried this is a terrible injury It must have bled considerably Yes it did I fainted when it was done and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time When I came to I found that it was still bleeding so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig Excellent You should have been a surgeon It is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province This has been done said I examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument A thing like a cleaver said he An accident I presume By no means What a murderous attack Very murderous indeed You horrify me I sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages He lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time How is that I asked when I had finished Capital Between your brandy and your bandage I feel a new man I was very weak but I have had a good deal to go through Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter It is evidently trying to your nerves Oh no not now I shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine I should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done Ha cried I if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police Oh I have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course I must use the official police as well Would you give me an introduction to him Ill do better Ill take you round to him myself I should be immensely obliged to you Well call a cab and go together We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him Do you feel equal to it Yes I shall not feel easy until I have told my story Then my servant will call a cab and I shall be with you in an instant I rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street Sherlock Holmes was as I expected lounging about his sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece He received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one Mr Hatherley said he Pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home Tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant Thank you said my patient but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while I sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us You must know said he that I am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in London By profession I am a hydraulic engineer and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner Matheson the wellknown firm of Greenwich Two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor fathers death I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience To me it has been exceptionally so During two years I have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me My gross takings amount to 27 10s Every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon I waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all Yesterday however just as I was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business He brought up a card too with the name of Colonel Lysander Stark engraved upon it Close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured He was plainly but neatly dressed and his age I should judge would be nearer forty than thirty Mr Hatherley said he with something of a German accent You have been recommended to me Mr Hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret I bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character Well perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London That is quite correct I answered but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me Undoubtedly so But you will find that all I say is really to the point I have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family If I promise to keep a secret said I you may absolutely depend upon my doing so He looked very hard at me as I spoke and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye Do you promise then said he at last Yes I promise Absolute and complete silence before during and after No reference to the matter at all either in word or writing I have already given you my word Very good He suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door The passage outside was empty Thats all right said he coming back I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters affairs Now we can talk in safety He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look A feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience I beg that you will state your business sir said I my time is of value Heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips How would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked Most admirably I say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves What do you think of such a commission as that The work appears to be light and the pay munificent Precisely so We shall want you to come tonight by the last train Where to To Eyford in Berkshire It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire and within seven miles of Reading There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 1115 Very good I shall come down in a carriage to meet you There is a drive then Yes our little place is quite out in the country It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station Then we can hardly get there before midnight I suppose there would be no chance of a train back I should be compelled to stop the night Yes we could easily give you a shakedown That is very awkward Could I not come at some more convenient hour We have judged it best that you should come late It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession Still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so I thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me Not at all said I I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes I should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do Quite so It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers Entirely Then the matter stands thus You are probably aware that fullersearth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in England I have heard so Some little time ago I bought a small placea very small placewithin ten miles of Reading I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullersearth in one of my fields On examining it however I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine Naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this I took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields This we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press This press as I have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject We guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford tonight I hope that I make it all plain I quite follow you said I The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fullersearth which as I understand is dug out like gravel from a pit Ah said he carelessly we have our own process We compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are But that is a mere detail I have taken you fully into my confidence now Mr Hatherley and I have shown you how I trust you He rose as he spoke I shall expect you then at Eyford at 1115 I shall certainly be there And not a word to a soul He looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room Well when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me On the one hand of course I was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones On the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and I could not think that his explanation of the fullersearth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand However I threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to Paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station However I was in time for the last train to Eyford and I reached the little dimlit station after eleven oclock I was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern As I passed out through the wicket gate however I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open He drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go One horse interjected Holmes Yes only one Did you observe the colour Yes I saw it by the sidelights when I was stepping into the carriage It was a chestnut Tiredlooking or fresh Oh fresh and glossy Thank you I am sorry to have interrupted you Pray continue your most interesting statement Away we went then and we drove for at least an hour Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles but I should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve He sat at my side in silence all the time and I was aware more than once when I glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged At last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a stand Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out and as I followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us We stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away It was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction It grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us I could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand Colonel Stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door It was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several German books were scattered Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door I shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness I glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry Then I walked across to the window hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it It was a wonderfully silent house There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me Who were these German people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place And where was the place I was ten miles or so from Eyford that was all I knew but whether north south east or west I had no idea For that matter Reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all Yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country I paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee Suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open The woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her I would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly I would go I should not stay here There is no good for you to do But madam said I I have not yet done what I came for I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine It is not worth your while to wait she went on You can pass through the door no one hinders And then seeing that I smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together For the love of Heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late But I am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way I thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me Was it all to go for nothing Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due This woman might for all I knew be a monomaniac With a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs She listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as Mr Ferguson This is my secretary and manager said the colonel By the way I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now I fear that you have felt the draught On the contrary said I I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close He shot one of his suspicious looks at me Perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he Mr Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine I had better put my hat on I suppose Oh no it is in the house What you dig fullersearth in the house No no This is only where we compress it But never mind that All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it We went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and I behind him It was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though I disregarded them and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellowcountryman Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked Within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time Ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in We are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you The machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right I took the lamp from him and I examined the machine very thoroughly It was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure When I passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders An examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked This was clearly the cause of the loss of power and I pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right When I had made it clear to them I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose The walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me What are you doing there he asked I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me I was admiring your fullersearth said I I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech His face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes Very well said he you shall know all about the machine He took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves Hullo I yelled Hullo Colonel Let me out And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder He had set the engine at work The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp I threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock I implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard rough surface Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap Easier the other way perhaps and yet had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me Already I was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood As I gave a last hurried glance around I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death The next instant I threw myself through and lay halffainting upon the other side The panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected Come come she cried breathlessly They will be here in a moment They will see that you are not there Oh do not waste the soprecious time but come This time at least I did not scorn her advice I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair The latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits end Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly It is your only chance said she It is high but it may be that you can jump it As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other I rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down I clambered out upon the sill but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me If she were illused then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back Fritz Fritz she cried in English remember your promise after the last time You said it should not be again He will be silent Oh he will be silent You are mad Elise he shouted struggling to break away from her You will be the ruin of us He has seen too much Let me pass I say He dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon I had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell I was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and I fell into the garden below I was shaken but not hurt by the fall so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet Suddenly however as I ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me I glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell It must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself My clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers But to my astonishment when I came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream Half dazed I went into the station and asked about the morning train There would be one to Reading in less than an hour The same porter was on duty I found as had been there when I arrived I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark The name was strange to him Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me No he had not Was there a policestation anywhere near There was one about three miles off It was too far for me to go weak and ill as I was I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police It was a little past six when I arrived so I went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings Here is an advertisement which will interest you said he It appeared in all the papers about a year ago Listen to this Lost on the 9th inst Mr Jeremiah Hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer Left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since Was dressed in etc etc Ha That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled I fancy Good heavens cried my patient Then that explains what the girl said Undoubtedly It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship Well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village There were Sherlock Holmes the hydraulic engineer Inspector Bradstreet of Scotland Yard a plainclothes man and myself Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre There you are said he That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village The place we want must be somewhere near that line You said ten miles I think sir It was an hours good drive And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious They must have done so I have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere What I cannot understand said I is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden Perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties I hardly think that likely I never saw a more inexorable face in my life Oh we shall soon clear up all that said Bradstreet Well I have drawn my circle and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found I think I could lay my finger on it said Holmes quietly Really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion Come now we shall see who agrees with you I say it is south for the country is more deserted there And I say east said my patient I am for west remarked the plainclothes man There are several quiet little villages up there And I am for north said I because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any Come cried the inspector laughing its a very pretty diversity of opinion We have boxed the compass among us Who do you give your casting vote to You are all wrong But we cant all be Oh yes you can This is my point He placed his finger in the centre of the circle This is where we shall find them But the twelvemile drive gasped Hatherley Six out and six back Nothing simpler You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads Indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed Bradstreet thoughtfully Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang None at all said Holmes They are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector They have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand We even traced them as far as Reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands But now thanks to this lucky chance I think that we have got them right enough But the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape A house on fire asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way Yes sir said the stationmaster When did it break out I hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze Whose house is it Dr Bechers Tell me broke in the engineer is Dr Becher a German very thin with a long sharp nose The stationmaster laughed heartily No sir Dr Becher is an Englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a betterlined waistcoat But he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as I understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm The stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire The road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under Thats it cried Hatherley in intense excitement There is the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where I lay That second window is the one that I jumped from Well at least said Holmes you have had your revenge upon them There can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now And Holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister German or the morose Englishman Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even Holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor About sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale He had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones On the whole it was most probable that the silent Englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger Well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London it has been a pretty business for me I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fiftyguinea fee and what have I gained Experience said Holmes laughing Indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence X THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR The Lord St Simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves Fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryearold drama As I have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode It was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him I had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence With my body in one easychair and my legs upon another I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day I tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be Here is a very fashionable epistle I remarked as he entered Your morning letters if I remember right were from a fishmonger and a tidewaiter Yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie He broke the seal and glanced over the contents Oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all Not social then No distinctly professional And from a noble client One of the highest in England My dear fellow I congratulate you I assure you Watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case It is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation You have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not It looks like it said I ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner I have had nothing else to do It is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column The latter is always instructive But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St Simon and his wedding Oh yes with the deepest interest That is well The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St Simon I will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter This is what he says MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMESLord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion I have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance I will call at four oclock in the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time I hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance Yours faithfully ROBERT ST SIMON It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle He says four oclock It is three now He will be here in an hour Then I have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while I take a glance as to who our client is He picked a redcovered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece Here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St Simon second son of the Duke of Balmoral Hum Arms Azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable Born in 1846 Hes fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage Was UnderSecretary for the colonies in a late administration The Duke his father was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent and Tudor on the distaff side Ha Well there is nothing very instructive in all this I think that I must turn to you Watson for something more solid I have very little difficulty in finding what I want said I for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable I feared to refer them to you however as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters Oh you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van That is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections Here is the first notice which I can find It is in the personal column of the Morning Post and dates as you see some weeks back A marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between Lord Robert St Simon second son of the Duke of Balmoral and Miss Hatty Doran the only daughter of Aloysius Doran Esq of San Francisco Cal USA That is all Terse and to the point remarked Holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week Ah here it is There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders Lord St Simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire Miss Doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as Lord St Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress Anything else asked Holmes yawning Oh yes plenty Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at St Georges Hanover Square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr Aloysius Doran Two days laterthat is on Wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwaters place near Petersfield Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride Before the what asked Holmes with a start The vanishing of the lady When did she vanish then At the wedding breakfast Indeed This is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact Yes it struck me as being a little out of the common They often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this Pray let me have the details I warn you that they are very incomplete Perhaps we may make them less so Such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which I will read to you It is headed Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding The family of Lord Robert St Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding The ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation The ceremony which was performed at St Georges Hanover Square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride Mr Aloysius Doran the Duchess of Balmoral Lord Backwater Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St Simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and Lady Alicia Whittington The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr Aloysius Doran at Lancaster Gate where breakfast had been prepared It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St Simon It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman The bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room Her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared Mr Aloysius Doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business Up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady There are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride And is that all Only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one And it is That Miss Flora Millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years There are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be I would not have missed it for worlds But there is a ring at the bell Watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client Do not dream of going Watson for I very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory Lord Robert St Simon announced our pageboy throwing open the door A gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed His manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked His hair too as he swept off his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top As to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters He advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses Goodday Lord St Simon said Holmes rising and bowing Pray take the basketchair This is my friend and colleague Dr Watson Draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over A most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine Mr Holmes I have been cut to the quick I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society No I am descending I beg pardon My last client of the sort was a king Oh really I had no idea And which king The King of Scandinavia What Had he lost his wife You can understand said Holmes suavely that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours Of course Very right very right Im sure I beg pardon As to my own case I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion Thank you I have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more I presume that I may take it as correctthis article for example as to the disappearance of the bride Lord St Simon glanced over it Yes it is correct as far as it goes But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you Pray do so When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran In San Francisco a year ago You were travelling in the States Yes Did you become engaged then No But you were on a friendly footing I was amused by her society and she could see that I was amused Her father is very rich He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope And how did he make his money In mining He had nothing a few years ago Then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds Now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour wifes character The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire You see Mr Holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster She is what we call in England a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions She is impetuousvolcanic I was about to say She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions On the other hand I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bearhe gave a little stately coughhad I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman I believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her Have you her photograph I brought this with me He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St Simon The young lady came to London then and you renewed your acquaintance Yes her father brought her over for this last London season I met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her She brought I understand a considerable dowry A fair dowry Not more than is usual in my family And this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli I really have made no inquiries on the subject Very naturally not Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding Yes Was she in good spirits Never better She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives Indeed That is very interesting And on the morning of the wedding She was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony And did you observe any change in her then Well to tell the truth I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp The incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case Pray let us have it for all that Oh it is childish She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry She was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew There was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall Yet when I spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause Indeed You say that there was a gentleman in the pew Some of the general public were present then Oh yes It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open This gentleman was not one of your wifes friends No no I call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a commonlooking person I hardly noticed his appearance But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point Lady St Simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it What did she do on reentering her fathers house I saw her in conversation with her maid And who is her maid Alice is her name She is an American and came from California with her A confidential servant A little too much so It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties Still of course in America they look upon these things in a different way How long did she speak to this Alice Oh a few minutes I had something else to think of You did not overhear what they said Lady St Simon said something about jumping a claim She was accustomed to use slang of the kind I have no idea what she meant American slang is very expressive sometimes And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid She walked into the breakfastroom On your arm No alone She was very independent in little matters like that Then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room She never came back But this maid Alice as I understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out Quite so And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at Mr Dorans house that morning Ah yes I should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her Lord St Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows We have been on a friendly footing for some yearsI may say on a very friendly footing She used to be at the Allegro I have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are Mr Holmes Flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and devotedly attached to me She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church She came to Mr Dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and I had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row Did your wife hear all this No thank goodness she did not And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards Yes That is what Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard looks upon as so serious It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her Well it is a possible supposition You think so too I did not say a probable one But you do not yourself look upon this as likely I do not think Flora would hurt a fly Still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters Pray what is your own theory as to what took place Well really I came to seek a theory not to propound one I have given you all the facts Since you ask me however I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife In short that she had become suddenly deranged Well really when I consider that she has turned her backI will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successI can hardly explain it in any other fashion Well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said Holmes smiling And now Lord St Simon I think that I have nearly all my data May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfasttable so that you could see out of the window We could see the other side of the road and the Park Quite so Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer I shall communicate with you Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising I have solved it Eh What was that I say that I have solved it Where then is my wife That is a detail which I shall speedily supply Lord St Simon shook his head I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately oldfashioned manner he departed It is very good of Lord St Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said Sherlock Holmes laughing I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this crossquestioning I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room My dear Holmes I have notes of several similar cases though none as I remarked before which were quite as prompt My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote Thoreaus example But I have heard all that you have heard Without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the FrancoPrussian War It is one of these casesbut hullo here is Lestrade Goodafternoon Lestrade You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box The official detective was attired in a peajacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him Whats up then asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye You look dissatisfied And I feel dissatisfied It is this infernal St Simon marriage case I can make neither head nor tail of the business Really You surprise me Who ever heard of such a mixed affair Every clue seems to slip through my fingers I have been at work upon it all day And very wet it seems to have made you said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket Yes I have been dragging the Serpentine In Heavens name what for In search of the body of Lady St Simon Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain he asked Why What do you mean Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion I suppose you know all about it he snarled Well I have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up Oh indeed Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter I think it very unlikely Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it He opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a weddingdress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water There said he putting a new weddingring upon the top of the pile There is a little nut for you to crack Master Holmes Oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air You dragged them from the Serpentine No They were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper They have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off By the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance I am afraid that you will find it difficult Are you indeed now cried Lestrade with some bitterness I am afraid Holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences You have made two blunders in as many minutes This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar And how In the dress is a pocket In the pocket is a cardcase In the cardcase is a note And here is the very note He slapped it down upon the table in front of him Listen to this You will see me when all is ready Come at once F H M Now my theory all along has been that Lady St Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance Here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach Very good Lestrade said Holmes laughing You really are very fine indeed Let me see it He took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction This is indeed important said he Ha you find it so Extremely so I congratulate you warmly Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look Why he shrieked youre looking at the wrong side On the contrary this is the right side The right side Youre mad Here is the note written in pencil over here And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply Theres nothing in it I looked at it before said Lestrade Oct 4th rooms 8s breakfast 2s 6d cocktail 1s lunch 2s 6d glass sherry 8d I see nothing in that Very likely not It is most important all the same As to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so I congratulate you again Ive wasted time enough said Lestrade rising I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories Goodday Mr Holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first He gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door Just one hint to you Lestrade drawled Holmes before his rival vanished I will tell you the true solution of the matter Lady St Simon is a myth There is not and there never has been any such person Lestrade looked sadly at my companion Then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so I think Watson that I must leave you to your papers for a little It was after five oclock when Sherlock Holmes left me but I had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioners man with a very large flat box This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodginghouse mahogany There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a pt de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles Having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the Arabian Nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address Just before nine oclock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room His features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions They have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands You seem to expect company They have laid for five Yes I fancy we may have some company dropping in said he I am surprised that Lord St Simon has not already arrived Ha I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features My messenger reached you then asked Holmes Yes and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure Have you good authority for what you say The best possible Lord St Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead What will the Duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation It is the purest accident I cannot allow that there is any humiliation Ah you look on these things from another standpoint I fail to see that anyone is to blame I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted Having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis It was a slight sir a public slight said Lord St Simon tapping his fingers upon the table You must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position I will make no allowance I am very angry indeed and I have been shamefully used I think that I heard a ring said Holmes Yes there are steps on the landing If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter Lord St Simon I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman Lord St Simon said he allow me to introduce you to Mr and Mrs Francis Hay Moulton The lady I think you have already met At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frockcoat a picture of offended dignity The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes It was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist Youre angry Robert said she Well I guess you have every cause to be Pray make no apology to me said Lord St Simon bitterly Oh yes I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went but I was kind of rattled and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didnt know what I was doing or saying I only wonder I didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar Perhaps Mrs Moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter If I may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already For my part I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it He was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner Then Ill tell our story right away said the lady Frank here and I met in 84 in McQuires camp near the Rockies where Pa was working a claim We were engaged to each other Frank and I but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank so at last Pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to Frisco Frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it It would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves Frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived Why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and then I will feel sure of you and I wont claim to be your husband until I come back Well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then Frank went off to seek his fortune and I went back to Pa The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana and then he went prospecting in Arizona and then I heard of him from New Mexico After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been attacked by Apache Indians and there was my Franks name among the killed I fainted dead away and I was very sick for months after Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in Frisco Not a word of news came for a year and more so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead Then Lord St Simon came to Frisco and we came to London and a marriage was arranged and Pa was very pleased but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank Still if I had married Lord St Simon of course Id have done my duty by him We cant command our love but we can our actions I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be But you may imagine what I felt when just as I came to the altar rails I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew I thought it was his ghost at first but when I looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him I wonder I didnt drop I know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear I didnt know what to do Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church I glanced at him again and he seemed to know what I was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper and I knew that he was writing me a note As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and I determined to do just whatever he might direct When I got back I told my maid who had known him in California and had always been his friend I ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St Simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards I hadnt been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park I slipped out put on my things and followed him Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St Simon to meseemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank We got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches had escaped came on to Frisco found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding I saw it in a paper explained the American It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived Then we had a talk as to what we should do and Frank was all for openness but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to Pa perhaps to show him that I was alive It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back So Frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that I should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman Mr Holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than I can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St Simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once Now Robert you have heard it all and I am very sorry if I have given you pain and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me Lord St Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative Excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner Then you wont forgive me You wont shake hands before I go Oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him I had hoped suggested Holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper I think that there you ask a little too much responded his Lordship I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very goodnight He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company said Sherlock Holmes It is always a joy to meet an American Mr Moulton for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes The case has been an interesting one remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard You were not yourself at fault at all then From the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home Obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind What could that something be She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom Had she seen someone then If she had it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely You see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an American Then who could this American be and why should he possess so much influence over her It might be a lover it might be a husband Her young womanhood had I knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St Simons narrative When he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear She had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter And how in the world did you find them It might have been difficult but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know The initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels How did you deduce the select By the select prices Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels There are not many in London which charge at that rate In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H Moulton an American gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square so thither I travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St Simon in particular I invited them to meet him here and as you see I made him keep the appointment But with no very good result I remarked His conduct was certainly not very gracious Ah Watson said Holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune I think that we may judge Lord St Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position Draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings XI THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET Holmes said I as I stood one morning in our bowwindow looking down the street here is a madman coming along It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressinggown looking over my shoulder It was a bright crisp February morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual Indeed from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention He was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs As he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions What on earth can be the matter with him I asked He is looking up at the numbers of the houses I believe that he is coming here said Holmes rubbing his hands Here Yes I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally I think that I recognise the symptoms Ha did I not tell you As he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging A few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity For a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason Then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ You have come to me to tell your story have you not said he You are fatigued with your haste Pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us No doubt you think me mad said he I see that you have had some great trouble responded Holmes God knows I havea trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it Public disgrace I might have faced although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain Private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul Besides it is not I alone The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair Pray compose yourself sir said Holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you My name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears I am Alexander Holder of the banking firm of Holder Stevenson of Threadneedle Street The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London What could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass We waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story I feel that time is of value said he that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your cooperation I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow That is why I was so out of breath for I am a man who takes very little exercise I feel better now and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can It is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks I started when I saw the name for it was that of none other thanwell perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earthone of the highest noblest most exalted names in England I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task Mr Holder said he I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money The firm does so when the security is good I answered It is absolutely essential to me said he that I should have 50000 at once I could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place ones self under obligations For how long may I ask do you want this sum I asked Next Monday I have a large sum due to me and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said I were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear If on the other hand I am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner I must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken I should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet One of the most precious public possessions of the empire said I Precisely He opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named There are thirtynine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked I am prepared to leave it with you as my security I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client You doubt its value he asked Not at all I only doubt The propriety of my leaving it You may set your mind at rest about that I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it It is a pure matter of form Is the security sufficient Ample You understand Mr Holder that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you founded upon all that I have heard of you I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them I leave it with you however with every confidence and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning Seeing that my client was anxious to leave I said no more but calling for my cashier I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 notes When I was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me There could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it However it was too late to alter the matter now so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me Bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be If so how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself I determined therefore that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach With this intention I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham carrying the jewel with me I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom And now a word as to my household Mr Holmes for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation My groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether I have three maidservants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion Another Lucy Parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service a few months She came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place That is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way So much for the servants My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it I am a widower and have an only son Arthur He has been a disappointment to me Mr Holmesa grievous disappointment I have no doubt that I am myself to blame People tell me that I have spoiled him Very likely I have When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face I have never denied him a wish Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner but I meant it for the best It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn He was wild wayward and to speak the truth I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to draw him back again And indeed I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner He is older than Arthur a man of the world to his fingertips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty Yet when I think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted So I think and so too thinks my little Mary who has a womans quick insight into character And now there is only she to be described She is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter She is a sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be She is my right hand I do not know what I could do without her In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes Twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too lateforever too late Now Mr Holmes you know the people who live under my roof and I shall continue with my miserable story When we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after dinner I told Arthur and Mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client Lucy Parr who had brought in the coffee had I am sure left the room but I cannot swear that the door was closed Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but I thought it better not to disturb it Where have you put it asked Arthur In my own bureau Well I hope to goodness the house wont be burgled during the night said he It is locked up I answered Oh any old key will fit that bureau When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard He often had a wild way of talking so that I thought little of what he said He followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face Look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have 200 No I cannot I answered sharply I have been far too generous with you in money matters You have been very kind said he but I must have this money or else I can never show my face inside the club again And a very good thing too I cried Yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he I could not bear the disgrace I must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then I must try other means I was very angry for this was the third demand during the month You shall not have a farthing from me I cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word When he was gone I unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again Then I started to go round the house to see that all was securea duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as I approached Tell me dad said she looking I thought a little disturbed did you give Lucy the maid leave to go out tonight Certainly not She came in just now by the back door I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped You must speak to her in the morning or I will if you prefer it Are you sure that everything is fastened Quite sure dad Then goodnight I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where I was soon asleep I am endeavouring to tell you everything Mr Holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear On the contrary your statement is singularly lucid I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so I am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual About two in the morning then I was awakened by some sound in the house It had ceased ere I was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere I lay listening with all my ears Suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room I slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom door Arthur I screamed you villain you thief How dare you touch that coronet The gas was half up as I had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands He appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death I snatched it up and examined it One of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing You blackguard I shouted beside myself with rage You have destroyed it You have dishonoured me forever Where are the jewels which you have stolen Stolen he cried Yes thief I roared shaking him by the shoulder There are none missing There cannot be any missing said he There are three missing And you know where they are Must I call you a liar as well as a thief Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece You have called me names enough said he I will not stand it any longer I shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world You shall leave it in the hands of the police I cried halfmad with grief and rage I shall have this matter probed to the bottom You shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature If you choose to call the police let the police find what they can By this time the whole house was astir for I had raised my voice in my anger Mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of Arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once When the inspector and a constable entered the house Arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property I was determined that the law should have its way in everything At least said he you will not have me arrested at once It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes That you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said I And then realising the dreadful position in which I was placed I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones You may as well face the matter said I you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous If you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him There was but one way for it I called in the inspector and gave him into custody A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats This morning he was removed to a cell and I after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it You may go to any expense which you think necessary I have already offered a reward of 1000 My God what shall I do I have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night Oh what shall I do He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire Do you receive much company he asked None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthurs Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately No one else I think Do you go out much in society Arthur does Mary and I stay at home We neither of us care for it That is unusual in a young girl She is of a quiet nature Besides she is not so very young She is fourandtwenty This matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also Terrible She is even more affected than I You have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands I hardly consider that a conclusive proof Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured Yes it was twisted Do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it God bless you You are doing what you can for him and for me But it is too heavy a task What was he doing there at all If his purpose were innocent why did he not say so Precisely And if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie His silence appears to me to cut both ways There are several singular points about the case What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep They considered that it might be caused by Arthurs closing his bedroom door A likely story As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household What did they say then of the disappearance of these gems They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them Have they thought of looking outside the house Yes they have shown extraordinary energy The whole garden has already been minutely examined Now my dear sir said Holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think It appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex Consider what is involved by your theory You suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered I ask you now is such a theory tenable But what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair If his motives were innocent why does he not explain them It is our task to find that out replied Holmes so now if you please Mr Holder we will set off for Streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which I was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened I confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still I had such faith in Holmes judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank the modest residence of the great financier Fairbank was a goodsized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road A double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance On the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance On the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane So long was he that Mr Holder and I went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in She was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face Her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint Disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked No no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom But I am so sure that he is innocent You know what womans instincts are I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly Why is he silent then if he is innocent Who knows Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him How could I help suspecting him when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand Oh but he had only picked it up to look at it Oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent Let the matter drop and say no more It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison I shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever Mary Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me Far from hushing the thing up I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it This gentleman she asked facing round to me No his friend He wished us to leave him alone He is round in the stable lane now The stable lane She raised her dark eyebrows What can he hope to find there Ah this I suppose is he I trust sir that you will succeed in proving what I feel sure is the truth that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime I fully share your opinion and I trust with you that we may prove it returned Holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder Might I ask you a question or two Pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up You heard nothing yourself last night Nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly I heard that and I came down You shut up the windows and doors the night before Did you fasten all the windows Yes Were they all fastened this morning Yes You have a maid who has a sweetheart I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him Yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet I see You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery But what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands Wait a little Mr Holder We must come back to that About this girl Miss Holder You saw her return by the kitchen door I presume Yes when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in I saw the man too in the gloom Do you know him Oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round His name is Francis Prosper He stood said Holmes to the left of the doorthat is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door Yes he did And he is a man with a wooden leg Something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive black eyes Why you are like a magician said she How do you know that She smiled but there was no answering smile in Holmes thin eager face I should be very glad now to go upstairs said he I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up He walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens Now we shall go upstairs said he at last The bankers dressingroom was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock Which key was used to open it he asked That which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the lumberroom Have you it here That is it on the dressingtable Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau It is a noiseless lock said he It is no wonder that it did not wake you This case I presume contains the coronet We must have a look at it He opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table It was a magnificent specimen of the jewellers art and the thirtysix stones were the finest that I have ever seen At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away Now Mr Holder said Holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost Might I beg that you will break it off The banker recoiled in horror I should not dream of trying said he Then I will Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result I feel it give a little said he but though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it An ordinary man could not do it Now what do you think would happen if I did break it Mr Holder There would be a noise like a pistol shot Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it I do not know what to think It is all dark to me But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go What do you think Miss Holder I confess that I still share my uncles perplexity Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt Thank you We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up With your permission Mr Holder I shall now continue my investigations outside He went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult For an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever I think that I have seen now all that there is to see Mr Holder said he I can serve you best by returning to my rooms But the gems Mr Holmes Where are they I cannot tell The banker wrung his hands I shall never see them again he cried And my son You give me hopes My opinion is in no way altered Then for Gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that I get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw I would give my fortune to have them back Very good I shall look into the matter between this and then Goodbye it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening It was obvious to me that my companions mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last I gave it over in despair It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer With his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class I think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace I only wish that you could come with me Watson but I fear that it wont do I may be on the trail in this matter or I may be following a willothewisp but I shall soon know which it is I hope that I may be back in a few hours He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition I had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his hand He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea I only looked in as I passed said he I am going right on Where to Oh to the other side of the West End It may be some time before I get back Dont wait up for me in case I should be late How are you getting on Oh so so Nothing to complain of I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last but I did not call at the house It is a very sweet little problem and I would not have missed it for a good deal However I must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply His eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks He hastened upstairs and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt I waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so I retired to my room It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise I do not know at what hour he came in but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible You will excuse my beginning without you Watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning Why it is after nine now I answered I should not be surprised if that were he I thought I heard a ring It was indeed our friend the financier I was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried said he Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another My niece Mary has deserted me Deserted you Yes Her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table I had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so It is to that remark that she refers in this note MY DEAREST UNCLEI feel that I have brought trouble upon you and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred I cannot with this thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and I feel that I must leave you forever Do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an illservice to me In life or in death I am ever your loving MARY What could she mean by that note Mr Holmes Do you think it points to suicide No no nothing of the kind It is perhaps the best possible solution I trust Mr Holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles Ha You say so You have heard something Mr Holmes you have learned something Where are the gems You would not think 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them I would pay ten That would be unnecessary Three thousand will cover the matter And there is a little reward I fancy Have you your chequebook Here is a pen Better make it out for 4000 With a dazed face the banker made out the required check Holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up You have it he gasped I am saved I am saved The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom There is one other thing you owe Mr Holder said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly Owe He caught up a pen Name the sum and I will pay it No the debt is not to me You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do should I ever chance to have one Then it was not Arthur who took them I told you yesterday and I repeat today that it was not You are sure of it Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known He knows it already When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story I told it to him on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me Your news of this morning however may open his lips For Heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery I will do so and I will show you the steps by which I reached it And let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary They have now fled together My Mary Impossible It is unfortunately more than possible it is certain Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle He is one of the most dangerous men in Englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience Your niece knew nothing of such men When he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart The devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening I cannot and I will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face I will tell you then what occurred in your house last night Your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane His footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there She told him of the coronet His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will I have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and I think that she must have been one She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true Your boy Arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom Petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair Presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands She passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath He saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right He rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight Sir George Burnwell tried to get away but Arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other In the scuffle your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye Then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene Is it possible gasped the banker You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands He took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried Mr Holder Oh my God what a blind fool I have been And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle How cruelly I have misjudged him When I arrived at the house continued Holmes I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me I knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions I passed along the tradesmens path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable Just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg I could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while Woodenleg had waited a little and then had gone away I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which I took to be the police but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me There was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son The first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other I followed them up and found they led to the hall window where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting Then I walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane I saw where Boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that I was not mistaken Boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt When he came to the highroad at the other end I found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue On entering the house however I examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and I could at once see that someone had passed out I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred A man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected He had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent So far I was clear The question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth Now I knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids But if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place There could be no possible reason As he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful one When I remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty And who could it be who was her confederate A lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you I knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one But among them was Sir George Burnwell I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family Well your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir Georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks I saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said Mr Holder Precisely It was I I found that I had my man so I came home and changed my clothes It was a delicate part which I had to play then for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter I went and saw him At first of course he denied everything But when I gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall I knew my man however and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike Then he became a little more reasonable I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held 1000 apiece That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown Why dash it all said he Ive let them go at six hundred for the three I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution Off I set to him and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 apiece Then I looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what I may call a really hard days work A day which has saved England from a great public scandal said the banker rising Sir I cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him As to what you tell me of poor Mary it goes to my very heart Not even your skill can inform me where she is now I think that we may safely say returned Holmes that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is It is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment XII THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES To the man who loves art for its own sake remarked Sherlock Holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived It is pleasant to me to observe Watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and I am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes clbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province And yet said I smiling I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records You have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter I remarked with some coldness for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular character No it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words If I claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond myself Crime is common Logic is rare Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales It was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street A thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings At the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law But in avoiding the sensational I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial The end may have been so I answered but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest Pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction But indeed if you are trivial I cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past Man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality As to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools I think that I have touched bottom at last however This note I had this morning marks my zeropoint I fancy Read it He tossed a crumpled letter across to me It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening and ran thus DEAR MR HOLMESI am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess I shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if I do not inconvenience you Yours faithfully VIOLET HUNTER Do you know the young lady I asked Not I It is halfpast ten now Yes and I have no doubt that is her ring It may turn out to be of more interest than you think You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation It may be so in this case also Well let us hope so But our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless I am much mistaken is the person in question As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room She was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plovers egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world You will excuse my troubling you I am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but I have had a very strange experience and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do Pray take a seat Miss Hunter I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client He looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his fingertips together to listen to her story I have been a governess for five years said she in the family of Colonel Spence Munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax in Nova Scotia and took his children over to America with him so that I found myself without a situation I advertised and I answered advertisements but without success At last the little money which I had saved began to run short and I was at my wits end as to what I should do There is a wellknown agency for governesses in the West End called Westaways and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me Westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by Miss Stoper She sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them Well when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper That will do said he I could not ask for anything better Capital capital He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion He was such a comfortablelooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him You are looking for a situation miss he asked Yes sir As governess Yes sir And what salary do you ask I had 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro Oh tut tut sweatingrank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments My accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said I A little French a little German music and drawing Tut tut he cried This is all quite beside the question The point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady There it is in a nutshell If you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country But if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures Your salary with me madam would commence at 100 a year You may imagine Mr Holmes that to me destitute as I was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true The gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocketbook and took out a note It is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man As I was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself May I ask where you live sir said I Hampshire Charming rural place The Copper Beeches five miles on the far side of Winchester It is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old countryhouse And my duties sir I should be glad to know what they would be One childone dear little romper just six years old Oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper Smack smack smack Three gone before you could wink He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again I was a little startled at the nature of the childs amusement but the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking My sole duties then I asked are to take charge of a single child No no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried Your duty would be as I am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey You see no difficulty heh I should be happy to make myself useful Quite so In dress now for example We are faddy people you knowfaddy but kindhearted If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim Heh No said I considerably astonished at his words Or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you Oh no Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us I could hardly believe my ears As you may observe Mr Holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut It has been considered artistic I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion I am afraid that that is quite impossible said I He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke I am afraid that it is quite essential said he It is a little fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted And so you wont cut your hair No sir I really could not I answered firmly Ah very well then that quite settles the matter It is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely In that case Miss Stoper I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked If you please Miss Stoper Well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you Goodday to you Miss Hunter She struck a gong upon the table and I was shown out by the page Well Mr Holmes when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing After all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity Very few governesses in England are getting 100 a year Besides what use was my hair to me Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake and by the day after I was sure of it I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself I have it here and I will read it to you The Copper Beeches near Winchester DEAR MISS HUNTERMiss Stoper has very kindly given me your address and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision My wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you We are willing to give 30 a quarter or 120 a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you They are not very exacting after all My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning You need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice now in Philadelphia which would I should think fit you very well Then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience As regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss Your duties as far as the child is concerned are very light Now do try to come and I shall meet you with the dogcart at Winchester Let me know your train Yours faithfully JEPHRO RUCASTLE That is the letter which I have just received Mr Holmes and my mind is made up that I will accept it I thought however that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration Well Miss Hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said Holmes smiling But you would not advise me to refuse I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for What is the meaning of it all Mr Holmes Ah I have no data I cannot tell Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion Well there seems to me to be only one possible solution Mr Rucastle seemed to be a very kind goodnatured man Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak That is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady But the money Mr Holmes the money Well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good That is what makes me uneasy Why should they give you 120 a year when they could have their pick for 40 There must be some strong reason behind I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me Oh you may carry that feeling away with you I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months There is something distinctly novel about some of the features If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger Danger What danger do you foresee Holmes shook his head gravely It would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he But at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help That is enough She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now I shall write to Mr Rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair tonight and start for Winchester tomorrow With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both goodnight and bustled off upon her way At least said I as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself And she would need to be said Holmes gravely I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past It was not very long before my friends prediction was fulfilled A fortnight went by during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into The unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine As to Holmes I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it Data data data he cried impatiently I cant make bricks without clay And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those allnight chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a testtube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning He opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me Just look up the trains in Bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies The summons was a brief and urgent one Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday tomorrow it said Do come I am at my wits end HUNTER Will you come with me asked Holmes glancing up I should wish to Just look it up then There is a train at halfpast nine said I glancing over my Bradshaw It is due at Winchester at 1130 That will do very nicely Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning By eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery It was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east The sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy All over the countryside away to the rolling hills around Aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage Are they not fresh and beautiful I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street But Holmes shook his head gravely Do you know Watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject You look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty I look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there Good heavens I cried Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads They always fill me with a certain horror It is my belief Watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside You horrify me But the reason is very obvious The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock But look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester I should never have had a fear for her It is the five miles of country which makes the danger Still it is clear that she is not personally threatened No If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away Quite so She has her freedom What can be the matter then Can you suggest no explanation I have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us Well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us She had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table I am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly It is so very kind of you both but indeed I do not know what I should do Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me Pray tell us what has happened to you I will do so and I must be quick for I have promised Mr Rucastle to be back before three I got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose Let us have everything in its due order Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen In the first place I may say that I have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from Mr and Mrs Rucastle It is only fair to them to say that But I cannot understand them and I am not easy in my mind about them What can you not understand Their reasons for their conduct But you shall have it all just as it occurred When I came down Mr Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dogcart to the Copper Beeches It is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather There are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door This ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of Lord Southertons preserves A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place I was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child There was no truth Mr Holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street Mrs Rucastle is not mad I found her to be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty I should think while he can hardly be less than fortyfive From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia Mr Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother As the daughter could not have been less than twenty I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife Mrs Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse She was a nonentity It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible He was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple And yet she had some secret sorrow this woman She would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face More than once I have surprised her in tears I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature He is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects But I would rather not talk about the creature Mr Holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story I am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not I shall try not to miss anything of importance The one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants There are only two a man and his wife Toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet Mr Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as Mrs Rucastle and much less amiable They are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet on the third Mrs Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband Oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you Miss Hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance We shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue It was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it Both Mr and Mrs Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence They were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor A chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it In this I was asked to sit and then Mr Rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to You cannot imagine how comical he was and I laughed until I was quite weary Mrs Rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face After an hour or so Mr Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances Again I changed my dress again I sat in the window and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense rpertoire and which he told inimitably Then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him I read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress You can easily imagine Mr Holmes how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be They were always very careful I observed to turn my face away from the window so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back At first it seemed to be impossible but I soon devised a means My handmirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief On the next occasion in the midst of my laughter I put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me I confess that I was disappointed There was nothing At least that was my first impression At the second glance however I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction The road is an important highway and there are usually people there This man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze She said nothing but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me She rose at once Jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter No friend of yours Miss Hunter he asked No I know no one in these parts Dear me How very impertinent Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away Surely it would be better to take no notice No no we should have him loitering here always Kindly turn round and wave him away like that I did as I was told and at the same instant Mrs Rucastle drew down the blind That was a week ago and from that time I have not sat again in the window nor have I worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road Pray continue said Holmes Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one You will find it rather disconnected I fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches Mr Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about Look in here said Mr Rucastle showing me a slit between two planks Is he not a beauty I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness Dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which I had given Its only Carlo my mastiff I call him mine but really old Toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him We feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard Toller lets him loose every night and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon For goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth The warning was no idle one for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning It was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day I was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was It was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done And now I have a very strange experience to tell you I had as you know cut off my hair in London and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk One evening after the child was in bed I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things There was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked I had filled the first two with my linen and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it The very first key fitted to perfection and I drew the drawer open There was only one thing in it but I am sure that you would never guess what it was It was my coil of hair I took it up and examined it It was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me How could my hair have been locked in the drawer With trembling hands I undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair I laid the two tresses together and I assure you that they were identical Was it not extraordinary Puzzle as I would I could make nothing at all of what it meant I returned the strange hair to the drawer and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked I am naturally observant as you may have remarked Mr Holmes and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head There was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked One day however as I ascended the stair I met Mr Rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom I was accustomed His cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look This aroused my curiosity so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house There were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up They were evidently all deserted As I strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally Mr Rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever Ah said he you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word my dear young lady I was preoccupied with business matters I assured him that I was not offended By the way said I you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up He looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark Photography is one of my hobbies said he I have made my dark room up there But dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon Who would have believed it Who would have ever believed it He spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me I read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest Well Mr Holmes from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know I was all on fire to go over them It was not mere curiosity though I have my share of that It was more a feeling of dutya feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place They talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling At any rate it was there and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door It was only yesterday that the chance came I may tell you that besides Mr Rucastle both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door Recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door I have no doubt at all that he had left it there Mr and Mrs Rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that I had an admirable opportunity I turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through There was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end Round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open They each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them The centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord The door itself was locked as well and the key was not there This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door A mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight Mr Holmes My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and I turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress I rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of Mr Rucastle who was waiting outside So said he smiling it was you then I thought that it must be when I saw the door open Oh I am so frightened I panted My dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady But his voice was just a little too coaxing He overdid it I was keenly on my guard against him I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing I answered But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again Oh it is so dreadfully still in there Only that said he looking at me keenly Why what did you think I asked Why do you think that I lock this door I am sure that I do not know It is to keep people out who have no business there Do you see He was still smiling in the most amiable manner I am sure if I had known Well then you know now And if you ever put your foot over that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demonIll throw you to the mastiff I was so terrified that I do not know what I did I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over Then I thought of you Mr Holmes I could not live there longer without some advice I was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child They were all horrible to me If I could only bring you down all would be well Of course I might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears My mind was soon made up I would send you a wire I put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning but I must be back before three oclock for Mr and Mrs Rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that I must look after the child Now I have told you all my adventures Mr Holmes and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what I should do Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story My friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face Is Toller still drunk he asked Yes I heard his wife tell Mrs Rucastle that she could do nothing with him That is well And the Rucastles go out tonight Yes Is there a cellar with a good strong lock Yes the winecellar You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl Miss Hunter Do you think that you could perform one more feat I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman I will try What is it We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven oclock my friend and I The Rucastles will be gone by that time and Toller will we hope be incapable There only remains Mrs Toller who might give the alarm If you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely I will do it Excellent We shall then look thoroughly into the affair Of course there is only one feasible explanation You have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber That is obvious As to who this prisoner is I have no doubt that it is the daughter Miss Alice Rucastle if I remember right who was said to have gone to America You were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair Hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also By a curious chance you came upon her tresses The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her fiancand no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her So much is fairly clear The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child What on earth has that to do with it I ejaculated My dear Watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents Dont you see that the converse is equally valid I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children This childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as I should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power I am sure that you are right Mr Holmes cried our client A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it Oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature We must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man We can do nothing until seven oclock At that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery We were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse The group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep Have you managed it asked Holmes A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs That is Mrs Toller in the cellar said she Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug Here are his keys which are the duplicates of Mr Rucastles You have done well indeed cried Holmes with enthusiasm Now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business We passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar Then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success No sound came from within and at the silence Holmes face clouded over I trust that we are not too late said he I think Miss Hunter that we had better go in without you Now Watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength Together we rushed into the room It was empty There was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen The skylight above was open and the prisoner gone There has been some villainy here said Holmes this beauty has guessed Miss Hunters intentions and has carried his victim off But how Through the skylight We shall soon see how he managed it He swung himself up onto the roof Ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves That is how he did it But it is impossible said Miss Hunter the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away He has come back and done it I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair I think Watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him You villain said he wheres your daughter The fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight It is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves Spies and thieves I have caught you have I You are in my power Ill serve you He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go Hes gone for the dog cried Miss Hunter I have my revolver said I Better close the front door cried Holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door My God he cried Someone has loosed the dog Its not been fed for two days Quick quick or itll be too late Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house with Toller hurrying behind us There was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in Rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground Running up I blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck With much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house We laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife I did what I could to relieve his pain We were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room Mrs Toller cried Miss Hunter Yes miss Mr Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you Ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for I would have told you that your pains were wasted Ha said Holmes looking keenly at her It is clear that Mrs Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else Yes sir I do and I am ready enough to tell what I know Then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark I will soon make it clear to you said she and Id have done so before now if I could ha got out from the cellar If theres policecourt business over this youll remember that I was the one that stood your friend and that I was Miss Alices friend too She was never happy at home Miss Alice wasnt from the time that her father married again She was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr Fowler at a friends house As well as I could learn Miss Alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr Rucastles hands He knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it He wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money When she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door Then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be Ah said Holmes I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that I can deduce all that remains Mr Rucastle then I presume took to this system of imprisonment Yes sir And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr Fowler That was it sir But Mr Fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his Mr Fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said Mrs Toller serenely And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out You have it sir just as it happened I am sure we owe you an apology Mrs Toller said Holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs Rucastle so I think Watson that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door Mr Rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife They still live with their old servants who probably know so much of Rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them Mr Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married by special license in Southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius As to Miss Violet Hunter my friend Holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall where I believe that she has met with considerable success End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart Oh Lucy And a Cockney besides said Lucy who had been further saddened by the Signoras unexpected accent It might be London She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people heavily framed at the notice of the English church Rev Cuthbert Eager M A Oxon that was the only other decoration of the wall Charlotte dont you feel too that we might be in London I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside I suppose it is ones being so tired This meat has surely been used for soup said Miss Bartlett laying down her fork I want so to see the Arno The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno The Signora had no business to do it at all Oh it is a shame Any nook does for me Miss Bartlett continued but it does seem hard that you shouldnt have a view Lucy felt that she had been selfish Charlotte you mustnt spoil me of course you must look over the Arno too I meant that The first vacant room in the front You must have it said Miss Bartlett part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucys mothera piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion No no You must have it I insist on it Your mother would never forgive me Lucy She would never forgive me The ladies voices grew animated andif the sad truth be owneda little peevish They were tired and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled Some of their neighbours interchanged glances and one of themone of the illbred people whom one does meet abroadleant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument He said I have a view I have a view Miss Bartlett was startled Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking and often did not find out that they would do till they had gone She knew that the intruder was illbred even before she glanced at him He was an old man of heavy build with a fair shaven face and large eyes There was something childish in those eyes though it was not the childishness of senility What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider for her glance passed on to his clothes These did not attract her He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her and then said A view Oh a view How delightful a view is This is my son said the old man his names George He has a view too Ah said Miss Bartlett repressing Lucy who was about to speak What I mean he continued is that you can have our rooms and well have yours Well change The better class of tourist was shocked at this and sympathized with the newcomers Miss Bartlett in reply opened her mouth as little as possible and said Thank you very much indeed that is out of the question Why said the old man with both fists on the table Because it is quite out of the question thank you You see we dont like to take began Lucy Her cousin again repressed her But why he persisted Women like looking at a view men dont And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child and turned to his son saying George persuade them Its so obvious they should have the rooms said the son Theres nothing else to say He did not look at the ladies as he spoke but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful Lucy too was perplexed but she saw that they were in for what is known as quite a scene and she had an odd feeling that whenever these illbred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt not with rooms and views but withwell with something quite different whose existence she had not realized before Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently Why should she not change What possible objection had she They would clear out in half an hour Miss Bartlett though skilled in the delicacies of conversation was powerless in the presence of brutality It was impossible to snub any one so gross Her face reddened with displeasure She looked around as much as to say Are you all like this And two little old ladies who were sitting further up the table with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs looked back clearly indicating We are not we are genteel Eat your dinner dear she said to Lucy and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite Eat your dinner dear This pension is a failure Tomorrow we will make a change Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it The curtains at the end of the room parted and revealed a clergyman stout but attractive who hurried forward to take his place at the table cheerfully apologizing for his lateness Lucy who had not yet acquired decency at once rose to her feet exclaiming Oh oh Why its Mr Beebe Oh how perfectly lovely Oh Charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are Oh Miss Bartlett said with more restraint How do you do Mr Beebe I expect that you have forgotten us Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St Peters that very cold Easter The clergyman who had the air of one on a holiday did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy I am so glad to see you said the girl who was in a state of spiritual starvation and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it Just fancy how small the world is Summer Street too makes it so specially funny Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street said Miss Bartlett filling up the gap and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living Yes I heard from mother so last week She didnt know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells but I wrote back at once and I said Mr Beebe is Quite right said the clergyman I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood Oh how glad I am The name of our house is Windy Corner Mr Beebe bowed There is mother and me generally and my brother though its not often we get him to ch The church is rather far off I mean Lucy dearest let Mr Beebe eat his dinner I am eating it thank you and enjoying it He preferred to talk to Lucy whose playing he remembered rather than to Miss Bartlett who probably remembered his sermons He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well and was informed at some length that she had never been there before It is delightful to advise a newcomer and he was first in the field Dont neglect the country round his advice concluded The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole and round by Settignano or something of that sort No cried a voice from the top of the table Mr Beebe you are wrong The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato That lady looks so clever whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin We are in luck And indeed a perfect torrent of information burst on them People told them what to see when to see it how to stop the electric trams how to get rid of the beggars how much to give for a vellum blotter how much the place would grow upon them The Pension Bertolini had decided almost enthusiastically that they would do Whichever way they looked kind ladies smiled and shouted at them And above all rose the voice of the clever lady crying Prato They must go to Prato That place is too sweetly squalid for words I love it I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know The young man named George glanced at the clever lady and then returned moodily to his plate Obviously he and his father did not do Lucy in the midst of her success found time to wish they did It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold and when she rose to go she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow The father did not see it the son acknowledged it not by another bow but by raising his eyebrows and smiling he seemed to be smiling across something She hastened after her cousin who had already disappeared through the curtainscurtains which smote one in the face and seemed heavy with more than cloth Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora bowing goodevening to her guests and supported by Enery her little boy and Victorier her daughter It made a curious little scene this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South And even more curious was the drawingroom which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boardinghouse Was this really Italy Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed armchair which had the colour and the contours of a tomato She was talking to Mr Beebe and as she spoke her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards slowly regularly as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle We are most grateful to you she was saying The first evening means so much When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart dheure He expressed his regret Do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner Emerson Is he a friend of yours We are friendlyas one is in pensions Then I will say no more He pressed her very slightly and she said more I am as it were she concluded the chaperon of my young cousin Lucy and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing His manner was somewhat unfortunate I hope I acted for the best You acted very naturally said he He seemed thoughtful and after a few moments added All the same I dont think much harm would have come of accepting No harm of course But we could not be under an obligation He is rather a peculiar man Again he hesitated and then said gently I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude He has the meritif it is oneof saying exactly what he means He has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite It is so difficultat least I find it difficultto understand people who speak the truth Lucy was pleased and said I was hoping that he was nice I do so always hope that people will be nice I think he is nice and tiresome I differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so I expectI may say I hopeyou will differ But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores When he first came here he not unnaturally put peoples backs up He has no tact and no mannersI dont mean by that that he has bad mannersand he will not keep his opinions to himself We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora but I am glad to say we thought better of it Am I to conclude said Miss Bartlett that he is a Socialist Mr Beebe accepted the convenient word not without a slight twitching of the lips And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist too I hardly know George for he hasnt learnt to talk yet He seems a nice creature and I think he has brains Of course he has all his fathers mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a Socialist Oh you relieve me said Miss Bartlett So you think I ought to have accepted their offer You feel I have been narrowminded and suspicious Not at all he answered I never suggested that But ought I not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness He replied with some irritation that it would be quite unnecessary and got up from his seat to go to the smokingroom Was I a bore said Miss Bartlett as soon as he had disappeared Why didnt you talk Lucy He prefers young people Im sure I do hope I havent monopolized him I hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinnertime He is nice exclaimed Lucy Just what I remember He seems to see good in everyone No one would take him for a clergyman My dear Lucia Well you know what I mean And you know how clergymen generally laugh Mr Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man Funny girl How you do remind me of your mother I wonder if she will approve of Mr Beebe Im sure she will and so will Freddy I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve it is the fashionable world I am used to Tunbridge Wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times Yes said Lucy despondently There was a haze of disapproval in the air but whether the disapproval was of herself or of Mr Beebe or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells she could not determine She tried to locate it but as usual she blundered Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one and added I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion And the girl again thought I must have been selfish or unkind I must be more careful It is so dreadful for Charlotte being poor Fortunately one of the little old ladies who for some time had been smiling very benignly now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr Beebe had sat Permission granted she began to chatter gently about Italy the plunge it had been to come there the gratifying success of the plunge the improvement in her sisters health the necessity of closing the bedroom windows at night and of thoroughly emptying the waterbottles in the morning She handled her subjects agreeably and they were perhaps more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room It was a real catastrophe not a mere episode that evening of hers at Venice when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea though one better than something else But here you are as safe as in England Signora Bertolini is so English Yet our rooms smell said poor Lucy We dread going to bed Ah then you look into the court She sighed If only Mr Emerson was more tactful We were so sorry for you at dinner I think he was meaning to be kind Undoubtedly he was said Miss Bartlett Mr Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature Of course I was holding back on my cousins account Of course said the little old lady and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl Lucy tried to look demure but could not help feeling a great fool No one was careful with her at home or at all events she had not noticed it About old Mr EmersonI hardly know No he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same timebeautiful Beautiful said Miss Bartlett puzzled at the word Are not beauty and delicacy the same So one would have thought said the other helplessly But things are so difficult I sometimes think She proceeded no further into things for Mr Beebe reappeared looking extremely pleasant Miss Bartlett he cried its all right about the rooms Im so glad Mr Emerson was talking about it in the smokingroom and knowing what I did I encouraged him to make the offer again He has let me come and ask you He would be so pleased Oh Charlotte cried Lucy to her cousin we must have the rooms now The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be Miss Bartlett was silent I fear said Mr Beebe after a pause that I have been officious I must apologize for my interference Gravely displeased he turned to go Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply My own wishes dearest Lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence when I am only here through your kindness If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms I will do it Would you then Mr Beebe kindly tell Mr Emerson that I accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that I may thank him personally She raised her voice as she spoke it was heard all over the drawingroom and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines The clergyman inwardly cursing the female sex bowed and departed with her message Remember Lucy I alone am implicated in this I do not wish the acceptance to come from you Grant me that at all events Mr Beebe was back saying rather nervously Mr Emerson is engaged but here is his son instead The young man gazed down on the three ladies who felt seated on the floor so low were their chairs My father he said is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first Young Mr Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy Poor young man said Miss Bartlett as soon as he had gone How angry he is with his father about the rooms It is all he can do to keep polite In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready said Mr Beebe Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins he retired to his own rooms to write up his philosophic diary Oh dear breathed the little old lady and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment Gentlemen sometimes do not realize Her voice faded away but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part Lucy not realizing either was reduced to literature Taking up Baedekers Handbook to Northern Italy she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow Thus the halfhour crept profitably away and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh and said I think one might venture now No Lucy do not stir I will superintend the move How you do do everything said Lucy Naturally dear It is my affair But I would like to help you No dear Charlottes energy And her unselfishness She had been thus all her life but really on this Italian tour she was surpassing herself So Lucy felt or strove to feel And yetthere was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful At all events she entered her own room without any feeling of joy I want to explain said Miss Bartlett why it is that I have taken the largest room Naturally of course I should have given it to you but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man and I was sure your mother would not like it Lucy was bewildered If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him I am a woman of the world in my small way and I know where things lead to However Mr Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this Mother wouldnt mind Im sure said Lucy but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues Miss Bartlett only sighed and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her goodnight It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato and the foothills of the Apennines black against the rising moon Miss Bartlett in her room fastened the windowshutters and locked the door and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances It was then that she saw pinned up over the washstand a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation Nothing more What does it mean she thought and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle Meaningless at first it gradually became menacing obnoxious portentous with evil She was seized with an impulse to destroy it but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so since it must be the property of young Mr Emerson So she unpinned it carefully and put it between two pieces of blottingpaper to keep it clean for him Then she completed her inspection of the room sighed heavily according to her habit and went to bed Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence to open the eyes upon a bright bare room with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons It was pleasant too to fling wide the windows pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite and close below the Arno gurgling against the embankment of the road Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore and on the river was a boat also diligently employed for some mysterious end An electric tram came rushing underneath the window No one was inside it except one tourist but its platforms were overflowing with Italians who preferred to stand Children tried to hang on behind and the conductor with no malice spat in their faces to make them let go Then soldiers appearedgoodlooking undersized menwearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur and a greatcoat which had been cut for some larger soldier Beside them walked officers looking foolish and fierce and before them went little boys turning somersaults in time with the band The tramcar became entangled in their ranks and moved on painfully like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants One of the little boys fell down and some white bullocks came out of an archway Indeed if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling buttonhooks the road might never have got clear Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto or the corruption of the Papacy may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in and having commented on Lucys leaving the door unlocked and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed should urge her to hasten herself or the best of the day would be gone By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs A conversation then ensued on not unfamiliar lines Miss Bartlett was after all a wee bit tired and thought they had better spend the morning settling in unless Lucy would at all like to go out Lucy would rather like to go out as it was her first day in Florence but of course she could go alone Miss Bartlett could not allow this Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere Oh certainly not Lucy would stop with her cousin Oh no that would never do Oh yes At this point the clever lady broke in If it is Mrs Grundy who is troubling you I do assure you that you can neglect the good person Being English Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe Italians understand A dear friend of mine Contessa Baroncelli has two daughters and when she cannot send a maid to school with them she lets them go in sailorhats instead Every one takes them for English you see especially if their hair is strained tightly behind Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncellis daughters She was determined to take Lucy herself her head not being so very bad The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce and if Lucy would come too she would be delighted I will take you by a dear dirty back way Miss Honeychurch and if you bring me luck we shall have an adventure Lucy said that this was most kind and at once opened the Baedeker to see where Santa Croce was Tut tut Miss Lucy I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker He does but touch the surface of things As to the true Italyhe does not even dream of it The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation This sounded very interesting and Lucy hurried over her breakfast and started with her new friend in high spirits Italy was coming at last The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream Miss Lavishfor that was the clever ladys nameturned to the right along the sunny Lung Arno How delightfully warm But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife didnt it Ponte alle Grazieparticularly interesting mentioned by Dante San Miniatobeautiful as well as interesting the crucifix that kissed a murdererMiss Honeychurch would remember the story The men on the river were fishing Untrue but then so is most information Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks and she stopped and she cried A smell a true Florentine smell Every city let me teach you has its own smell Is it a very nice smell said Lucy who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt One doesnt come to Italy for niceness was the retort one comes for life Buon giorno Buon giorno bowing right and left Look at that adorable winecart How the driver stares at us dear simple soul So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence short fidgety and playful as a kitten though without a kittens grace It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful and a blue military cloak such as an Italian officer wears only increased the sense of festivity Buon giorno Take the word of an old woman Miss Lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors That is the true democracy Though I am a real Radical as well There now youre shocked Indeed Im not exclaimed Lucy We are Radicals too out and out My father always voted for Mr Gladstone until he was so dreadful about Ireland I see I see And now you have gone over to the enemy Oh please If my father was alive I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right And as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and Freddy is sure it was the Tories but mother says nonsense a tramp Shameful A manufacturing district I suppose Noin the Surrey hills About five miles from Dorking looking over the Weald Miss Lavish seemed interested and slackened her trot What a delightful part I know it so well It is full of the very nicest people Do you know Sir Harry Otwaya Radical if ever there was Very well indeed And old Mrs Butterworth the philanthropist Why she rents a field of us How funny Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky and murmured Oh you have property in Surrey Hardly any said Lucy fearful of being thought a snob Only thirty acresjust the garden all downhill and some fields Miss Lavish was not disgusted and said it was just the size of her aunts Suffolk estate Italy receded They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year but she had not liked it which was odd of her And just as Miss Lavish had got the name she broke off and exclaimed Bless us Bless us and save us Weve lost the way Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings Lost lost My dear Miss Lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us What are we to do Two lone females in an unknown town Now this is what I call an adventure Lucy who wanted to see Santa Croce suggested as a possible solution that they should ask the way there Oh but that is the word of a craven And no you are not not not to look at your Baedeker Give it to me I shant let you carry it We will simply drift Accordingly they drifted through a series of those greybrown streets neither commodious nor picturesque in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa and became discontented herself For one ravishing moment Italy appeared She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terracotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale There they stood with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful but Miss Lavish with a shriek of dismay dragged her forward declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins or rather ceases to tell and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop because it looked so typical It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped partly of hair oil partly of the great unknown But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza large and dusty on the farther side of which rose a blackandwhite faade of surpassing ugliness Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically It was Santa Croce The adventure was over Stop a minute let those two people go on or I shall have to speak to them I do detest conventional intercourse Nasty they are going into the church too Oh the Britisher abroad We sat opposite them at dinner last night They have given us their rooms They were so very kind Look at their figures laughed Miss Lavish They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows Its very naughty of me but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover and turn back every tourist who couldnt pass it What would you ask us Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucys arm as if to suggest that she at all events would get full marks In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped squeaked flung up her arms and cried There goes my localcolour box I must have a word with him And in a moment she was away over the Piazza her military cloak flapping in the wind nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers and nipped him playfully upon the arm Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes Then she began to get tired The beggars worried her the dust blew in her eyes and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish who was really almost too original But at that moment Miss Lavish and her localcolour box moved also and disappeared down a side street both gesticulating largely Tears of indignation came to Lucys eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her partly because she had taken her Baedeker How could she find her way home How could she find her way about in Santa Croce Her first morning was ruined and she might never be in Florence again A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits talking as a woman of culture and half persuading herself that she was full of originality Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans Of course it must be a wonderful building But how like a barn And how very cold Of course it contained frescoes by Giotto in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper But who was to tell her which they were She walked about disdainfully unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date There was no one even to tell her which of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts was the one that was really beautiful the one that had been most praised by Mr Ruskin Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her and instead of acquiring information she began to be happy She puzzled out the Italian noticesthe notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the churchthe notice that prayed people in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves not to spit She watched the tourists their noses were as red as their Baedekers so cold was Santa Croce She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papiststwo hebabies and a shebabywho began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial dripping but hallowed Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances they touched the stone with their fingers with their handkerchiefs with their heads and then retreated What could this mean They did it again and again Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint hoping to acquire virtue Punishment followed quickly The smallest hebaby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr Ruskin and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop Protestant as she was Lucy darted forward She was too late He fell heavily upon the prelates upturned toes Hateful bishop exclaimed the voice of old Mr Emerson who had darted forward also Hard in life hard in death Go out into the sunshine little boy and kiss your hand to the sun for that is where you ought to be Intolerable bishop The child screamed frantically at these words and at these dreadful people who picked him up dusted him rubbed his bruises and told him not to be superstitious Look at him said Mr Emerson to Lucy Heres a mess a baby hurt cold and frightened But what else can you expect from a church The childs legs had become as melting wax Each time that old Mr Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar Fortunately an Italian lady who ought to have been saying her prayers came to the rescue By some mysterious virtue which mothers alone possess she stiffened the little boys backbone and imparted strength to his knees He stood Still gibbering with agitation he walked away You are a clever woman said Mr Emerson You have done more than all the relics in the world I am not of your creed but I do believe in those who make their fellowcreatures happy There is no scheme of the universe He paused for a phrase Niente said the Italian lady and returned to her prayers Im not sure she understands English suggested Lucy In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons She was determined to be gracious to them beautiful rather than delicate and if possible to erase Miss Bartletts civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms That woman understands everything was Mr Emersons reply But what are you doing here Are you doing the church Are you through with the church No cried Lucy remembering her grievance I came here with Miss Lavish who was to explain everything and just by the doorit is too badshe simply ran away and after waiting quite a time I had to come in by myself Why shouldnt you said Mr Emerson Yes why shouldnt you come by yourself said the son addressing the young lady for the first time But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker Baedeker said Mr Emerson Im glad its that you minded Its worth minding the loss of a Baedeker Thats worth minding Lucy was puzzled She was again conscious of some new idea and was not sure whither it would lead her If youve no Baedeker said the son youd better join us Was this where the idea would lead She took refuge in her dignity Thank you very much but I could not think of that I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you I really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience My dear said the old man gently I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say You are pretending to be touchy but you are not really Stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see To take you to it will be a real pleasure Now this was abominably impertinent and she ought to have been furious But it is sometimes as difficult to lose ones temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it Lucy could not get cross Mr Emerson was an old man and surely a girl might humour him On the other hand his son was a young man and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him or at all events be offended before him It was at him that she gazed before replying I am not touchy I hope It is the Giottos that I want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are The son nodded With a look of sombre satisfaction he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel There was a hint of the teacher about him She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer directing them how to worship Giotto not by tactful valuations but by the standards of the spirit Remember he was saying the facts about this church of Santa Croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared Observe how Giotto in these frescoesnow unhappily ruined by restorationis untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective Could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true How little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels No exclaimed Mr Emerson in much too loud a voice for church Remember nothing of the sort Built by faith indeed That simply means the workmen werent paid properly And as for the frescoes I see no truth in them Look at that fat man in blue He must weigh as much as I do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon He was referring to the fresco of the Ascension of St John Inside the lecturers voice faltered as well it might The audience shifted uneasily and so did Lucy She was sure that she ought not to be with these men but they had cast a spell over her They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave Now did this happen or didnt it Yes or no George replied It happened like this if it happened at all I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here You will never go up said his father You and I dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives Some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up It did happen like that if it happened at all Pardon me said a frigid voice The chapel is somewhat small for two parties We will incommode you no longer The lecturer was a clergyman and his audience must be also his flock for they held prayerbooks as well as guidebooks in their hands They filed out of the chapel in silence Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension BertoliniMiss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan Stop cried Mr Emerson Theres plenty of room for us all Stop The procession disappeared without a word Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel describing the life of St Francis George I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate George went into the next chapel and returned saying Perhaps he is I dont remember Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am Its that Mr Eager Why did he go Did we talk too loud How vexatious I shall go and say we are sorry Hadnt I better Then perhaps he will come back He will not come back said George But Mr Emerson contrite and unhappy hurried away to apologize to the Rev Cuthbert Eager Lucy apparently absorbed in a lunette could hear the lecture again interrupted the anxious aggressive voice of the old man the curt injured replies of his opponent The son who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy was listening also My father has that effect on nearly everyone he informed her He will try to be kind I hope we all try said she smiling nervously Because we think it improves our characters But he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened How silly of them said Lucy though in her heart she sympathized I think that a kind action done tactfully Tact He threw up his head in disdain Apparently she had given the wrong answer She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel For a young man his face was rugged anduntil the shadows fell upon ithard Enshadowed it sprang into tenderness She saw him once again at Rome on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel carrying a burden of acorns Healthy and muscular he yet gave her the feeling of greyness of tragedy that might only find solution in the night The feeling soon passed it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle Born of silence and of unknown emotion it passed when Mr Emerson returned and she could reenter the world of rapid talk which was alone familiar to her Were you snubbed asked his son tranquilly But we have spoilt the pleasure of I dont know how many people They wont come back full of innate sympathyquickness to perceive good in othersvision of the brotherhood of man Scraps of the lecture on St Francis came floating round the partition wall Dont let us spoil yours he continued to Lucy Have you looked at those saints Yes said Lucy They are lovely Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin He did not know and suggested that they should try to guess it George rather to her relief refused to move and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce which though it is like a barn has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars and an old lady with her dog and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists But Mr Emerson was only half interested He watched the lecturer whose success he believed he had impaired and then he anxiously watched his son Why will he look at that fresco he said uneasily I saw nothing in it I like Giotto she replied It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better So you ought A baby is worth a dozen saints And my babys worth the whole of Paradise and as far as I can see he lives in Hell Lucy again felt that this did not do In Hell he repeated Hes unhappy Oh dear said Lucy How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive What more is one to give him And think how he has been brought upfree from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God With such an education as that I thought he was bound to grow up happy She was no theologian but she felt that here was a very foolish old man as well as a very irreligious one She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person and that Charlotte would object most strongly What are we to do with him he asked He comes out for his holiday to Italy and behaveslike that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone Eh What did you say Lucy had made no suggestion Suddenly he said Now dont be stupid over this I dont require you to fall in love with my boy but I do think you might try and understand him You are nearer his age and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible You might help me He has known so few women and you have the time You stop here several weeks I suppose But let yourself go You are inclined to get muddled if I may judge from last night Let yourself go Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself It will be good for both of you To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer I only know what it is thats wrong with him not why it is And what is it asked Lucy fearfully expecting some harrowing tale The old trouble things wont fit What things The things of the universe It is quite true They dont Oh Mr Emerson whatever do you mean In his ordinary voice so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry he said From far from eve and morning And yon twelvewinded sky The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither here am I George and I both know this but why does it distress him We know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness But why should this make us unhappy Let us rather love one another and work and rejoice I dont believe in this world sorrow Miss Honeychurch assented Then make my boy think like us Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yesa transitory Yes if you like but a Yes Suddenly she laughed surely one ought to laugh A young man melancholy because the universe wouldnt fit because life was a tangle or a wind or a Yes or something Im very sorry she cried Youll think me unfeeling butbut Then she became matronly Oh but your son wants employment Has he no particular hobby Why I myself have worries but I can generally forget them at the piano and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother Perhaps Italy bores him you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes The old mans face saddened and he touched her gently with his hand This did not alarm her she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it Indeed he no longer alarmed her at all she regarded him as a kind thing but quite silly Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically before she lost Baedeker The dear George now striding towards them over the tombstones seemed both pitiable and absurd He approached his face in the shadow He said Miss Bartlett Oh good gracious me said Lucy suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective Where Where In the nave I see Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have She checked herself Poor girl exploded Mr Emerson Poor girl She could not let this pass for it was just what she was feeling herself Poor girl I fail to understand the point of that remark I think myself a very fortunate girl I assure you Im thoroughly happy and having a splendid time Pray dont waste time mourning over me Theres enough sorrow in the world isnt there without trying to invent it Goodbye Thank you both so much for all your kindness Ah yes there does come my cousin A delightful morning Santa Croce is a wonderful church She joined her cousin Chapter III Music Violets and the Letter S It so happened that Lucy who found daily life rather chaotic entered a more solid world when she opened the piano She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing no longer either a rebel or a slave The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected The commonplace person begins to play and shoots into the empyrean without effort whilst we look up marvelling how he has escaped us and thinking how we could worship him and love him would he but translate his visions into human words and his experiences into human actions Perhaps he cannot certainly he does not or does so very seldom Lucy had done so never She was no dazzling excutante her runs were not at all like strings of pearls and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation Nor was she the passionate young lady who performs so tragically on a summers evening with the window open Passion was there but it could not be easily labelled it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy and all the furniture of the pictorial style And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great for she loved to play on the side of Victory Victory of what and over whatthat is more than the words of daily life can tell us But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides and Lucy had decided that they should triumph A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked and after lunch she opened the little draped piano A few people lingered round and praised her playing but finding that she made no reply dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep She took no notice of Mr Emerson looking for his son nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarettecase Like every true performer she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes they were fingers caressing her own and by touch not by sound alone did she come to her desire Mr Beebe sitting unnoticed in the window pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower The seats were filled with a respectful audience and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish under the auspices of their vicar sang or recited or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork Among the promised items was Miss Honeychurch Piano Beethoven and Mr Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida or the march of The Ruins of Athens when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III He was in suspense all through the introduction for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory He was glad that she only played the first movement for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of ninesixteen The audience clapped no less respectful It was Mr Beebe who started the stamping it was all that one could do Who is she he asked the vicar afterwards Cousin of one of my parishioners I do not consider her choice of a piece happy Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs Introduce me She will be delighted She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon My sermon cried Mr Beebe Why ever did she listen to it When he was introduced he understood why for Miss Honeychurch disjoined from her music stool was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty pale undeveloped face She loved going to concerts she loved stopping with her cousin she loved iced coffee and meringues He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays it will be very exciting both for us and for her Lucy at once reentered daily life Oh what a funny thing Some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted I should never live a duet Doesnt Mrs Honeychurch like music She doesnt mind it But she doesnt like one to get excited over anything she thinks I am silly about it She thinksI cant make out Once you know I said that I liked my own playing better than any ones She has never got over it Of course I didnt mean that I played well I only meant Of course said he wondering why she bothered to explain Music said Lucy as if attempting some generality She could not complete it and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet The whole life of the South was disorganized and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes The street and the river were dirty yellow the bridge was dirty grey and the hills were dirty purple Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo What about music said Mr Beebe Poor Charlotte will be sopped was Lucys reply The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett who would return cold tired hungry and angelic with a ruined skirt a pulpy Baedeker and a tickling cough in her throat On another day when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth like wine she would refuse to stir from the drawingroom saying that she was an old thing and no fit companion for a hearty girl Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe Miss Lavish is so original murmured Lucy This was a stock remark the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition Miss Lavish was so original Mr Beebe had his doubts but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness For that and for other reasons he held his peace Is it true continued Lucy in awestruck tone that Miss Lavish is writing a book They do say so What is it about It will be a novel replied Mr Beebe dealing with modern Italy Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself We started such friends But I dont think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so I couldnt help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish The two ladies at all events have made it up He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish They were always in each others company with Lucy a slighted third Miss Lavish he believed he understood but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness though not perhaps of meaning Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies they were his specialty and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work Girls like Lucy were charming to look at but Mr Beebe was from rather profound reasons somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled Lucy for the third time said that poor Charlotte would be sopped The Arno was rising in flood washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore But in the southwest there had appeared a dull haze of yellow which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse She opened the window to inspect and a cold blast entered the room drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan who entered at the same moment by the door Oh dear Miss Honeychurch you will catch a chill And Mr Beebe here besides Who would suppose this is Italy There is my sister actually nursing the hotwater can no comforts or proper provisions She sidled towards them and sat down selfconscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man or a man and one woman I could hear your beautiful playing Miss Honeychurch though I was in my room with the door shut Doors shut indeed most necessary No one has the least idea of privacy in this country And one person catches it from another Lucy answered suitably Mr Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath exclaiming cheerfully Fa niente sono vecchia He contented himself with saying I quite agree with you Miss Alan The Italians are a most unpleasant people They pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves We are at their mercy They read our thoughts they foretell our desires From the cabdriver down toto Giotto they turn us inside out and I resent it Yet in their heart of hearts they arehow superficial They have no conception of the intellectual life How right is Signora Bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day Ho Mr Beebe if you knew what I suffer over the childrens edjucaishion Hi wont ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what cant explain nothink Miss Alan did not follow but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr Beebe having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers Indeed who would have supposed that tolerance sympathy and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle and at last the cause was disclosed From the chair beneath her she extracted a gunmetal cigarettecase on which were powdered in turquoise the initials E L That belongs to Lavish said the clergyman A good fellow Lavish but I wish shed start a pipe Oh Mr Beebe said Miss Alan divided between awe and mirth Indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose She took to it practically in despair after her lifes work was carried away in a landslip Surely that makes it more excusable What was that asked Lucy Mr Beebe sat back complacently and Miss Alan began as follows It was a noveland I am afraid from what I can gather not a very nice novel It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and I must say they nearly always do Anyhow she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink She said Can I have a little ink please But you know what Italians are and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written The poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes It is a great secret but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colourthis novel is to be about modern Italy the other was historicalbut that she could not start till she had an idea First she tried Perugia for an inspiration then she came herethis must on no account get round And so cheerful through it all I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks giving them unexpected beauty just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring She felt she had made almost too many allowances and apologized hurriedly for her toleration All the same she is a little tooI hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived Mr Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman I dont know Miss Honeychurch if you have noticed that Miss Pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade That old Mr Emerson who puts things very strangely Her jaw dropped She was silent Mr Beebe whose social resources were endless went out to order some tea and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper Stomach He warned Miss Pole of her stomachacidity he called itand he may have meant to be kind I must say I forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden As Teresa truly said it was no laughing matter But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning S and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought She thought they were commercial travellersdrummers was the word she usedand all through dinner she tried to prove that England our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce Teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so There Miss Lavish is one who can confute you better than I and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson Then Miss Lavish said Tut The early Victorians Just imagine Tut The early Victorians My sister had gone and I felt bound to speak I said Miss Lavish I am an early Victorian at least that is to say I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen It was horrible speaking I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go and I must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply But unluckily Mr Emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice Quite so quite so I honour the woman for her Irish visit The woman I tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of S having been mentioned in the first place But that was not all After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said Miss Alan I am going into the smokingroom to talk to those two nice men Come too Needless to say I refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all University men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers Let me finish the story said Mr Beebe who had returned Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole myself everyone and finally said I shall go alone She went At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience Whatever happened cried Lucy No one knows No one will ever know Miss Lavish will never dare to tell and Mr Emerson does not think it worth telling Mr Beebeold Mr Emerson is he nice or not nice I do so want to know Mr Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself No but it is so difficult Sometimes he is so silly and then I do not mind him Miss Alan what do you think Is he nice The little old lady shook her head and sighed disapprovingly Mr Beebe whom the conversation amused stirred her up by saying I consider that you are bound to class him as nice Miss Alan after that business of the violets Violets Oh dear Who told you about the violets How do things get round A pension is a bad place for gossips No I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr Eagers lecture at Santa Croce Oh poor Miss Honeychurch It really was too bad No I have quite changed I do not like the Emersons They are not nice Mr Beebe smiled nonchalantly He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society and the effort had failed He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them Miss Lavish who represented intellect was avowedly hostile and now the Miss Alans who stood for good breeding were following her Miss Bartlett smarting under an obligation would scarcely be civil The case of Lucy was different She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her to show her the world from their own strange standpoint to interest her in their private sorrows and joys This was impertinent he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl he would rather it should fail After all he knew nothing about them and pension joys pension sorrows are flimsy things whereas Lucy would be his parishioner Lucy with one eye upon the weather finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice not that she saw anything of them now Even their seats at dinner had been moved But arent they always waylaying you to go out with them dear said the little lady inquisitively Only once Charlotte didnt like it and said somethingquite politely of course Most right of her They dont understand our ways They must find their level Mr Beebe rather felt that they had gone under They had given up their attemptif it was oneto conquer society and now the father was almost as silent as the son He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they leftsome expedition perhaps with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them It was one of Mr Beebes chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories Evening approached while they chatted the air became brighter the colours on the trees and hills were purified and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle There were a few streaks of bluishgreen among the clouds a few patches of watery light upon the earth and then the dripping faade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun Too late to go out said Miss Alan in a voice of relief All the galleries are shut I think I shall go out said Lucy I want to go round the town in the circular tramon the platform by the driver Her two companions looked grave Mr Beebe who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett ventured to say I wish we could Unluckily I have letters If you do want to go out alone wont you be better on your feet Italians dear you know said Miss Alan Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through But they still looked disapproval and she so far conceded to Mr Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk and keep to the street frequented by tourists She oughtnt really to go at all said Mr Beebe as they watched her from the window and she knows it I put it down to too much Beethoven Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr Beebe was right Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music She had not really appreciated the clergymans wit nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan Conversation was tedious she wanted something big and she believed that it would have come to her on the windswept platform of an electric tram This she might not attempt It was unladylike Why Why were most big things unladylike Charlotte had once explained to her why It was not that ladies were inferior to men it was that they were different Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves Indirectly by means of tact and a spotless name a lady could accomplish much But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured then despised and finally ignored Poems had been written to illustrate this point There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady The dragons have gone and so have the knights but still she lingers in our midst She reigned in many an early Victorian castle and was Queen of much early Victorian song It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well But alas the creature grows degenerate In her heart also there are springing up strange desires She too is enamoured of heavy winds and vast panoramas and green expanses of the sea She has marked the kingdom of this world how full it is of wealth and beauty and wara radiant crust built around the central fires spinning towards the receding heavens Men declaring that she inspires them to it move joyfully over the surface having the most delightful meetings with other men happy not because they are masculine but because they are alive Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman and go there as her transitory self Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious Nor has she any system of revolt Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly and she would transgress it and perhaps be sorry that she had done so This afternoon she was peculiarly restive She would really like to do something of which her wellwishers disapproved As she might not go on the electric tram she went to Alinaris shop There she bought a photograph of Botticellis Birth of Venus Venus being a pity spoilt the picture otherwise so charming and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it A pity in art of course signified the nude Giorgiones Tempesta the Idolino some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos were added to it She felt a little calmer then and bought Fra Angelicos Coronation Giottos Ascension of St John some Della Robbia babies and some Guido Reni Madonnas For her taste was catholic and she extended uncritical approval to every wellknown name But though she spent nearly seven lire the gates of liberty seemed still unopened She was conscious of her discontent it was new to her to be conscious of it The world she thought is certainly full of beautiful things if only I could come across them It was not surprising that Mrs Honeychurch disapproved of music declaring that it always left her daughter peevish unpractical and touchy Nothing ever happens to me she reflected as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels now fairly familiar to her The great square was in shadow the sunshine had come too late to strike it Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight half god half ghost and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave wherein many a deity shadowy but immortal looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind It was the hour of unrealitythe hour that is when unfamiliar things are real An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him and rest content Lucy desired more She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold It seemed no longer a tower no longer supported by earth but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky Its brightness mesmerized her still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home Then something did happen Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt Cinque lire they had cried cinque lire They sparred at each other and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest He frowned he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest as if he had an important message for her He opened his lips to deliver it and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin That was all A crowd rose out of the dusk It hid this extraordinary man from her and bore him away to the fountain Mr George Emerson happened to be a few paces away looking at her across the spot where the man had been How very odd Across something Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim the palace itself grew dim swayed above her fell on to her softly slowly noiselessly and the sky fell with it She thought Oh what have I done Oh what have I done she murmured and opened her eyes George Emerson still looked at her but not across anything She had complained of dullness and lo one man was stabbed and another held her in his arms They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade He must have carried her He rose when she spoke and began to dust his knees She repeated Oh what have I done You fainted II am very sorry How are you now Perfectly wellabsolutely well And she began to nod and smile Then let us come home Theres no point in our stopping He held out his hand to pull her up She pretended not to see it The cries from the fountainthey had never ceasedrang emptily The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning How very kind you have been I might have hurt myself falling But now I am well I can go alone thank you His hand was still extended Oh my photographs she exclaimed suddenly What photographs I bought some photographs at Alinaris I must have dropped them out there in the square She looked at him cautiously Would you add to your kindness by fetching them He added to his kindness As soon as he had turned his back Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno Miss Honeychurch She stopped with her hand on her heart You sit still you arent fit to go home alone Yes I am thank you so very much No you arent Youd go openly if you were But I had rather Then I dont fetch your photographs I had rather be alone He said imperiously The man is deadthe man is probably dead sit down till you are rested She was bewildered and obeyed him And dont move till I come back In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods such as appear in dreams The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day and joined itself to earth How should she talk to Mr Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square Again the thought occurred to her Oh what have I donethe thought that she as well as the dying man had crossed some spiritual boundary He returned and she talked of the murder Oddly enough it was an easy topic She spoke of the Italian character she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before Being strong physically she soon overcame the horror of blood She rose without his assistance and though wings seemed to flutter inside her she walked firmly enough towards the Arno There a cabman signalled to them they refused him And the murderer tried to kiss him you sayhow very odd Italians areand gave himself up to the police Mr Beebe was saying that Italians know everything but I think they are rather childish When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterdayWhat was that He had thrown something into the stream What did you throw in Things I didnt want he said crossly Mr Emerson Well Where are the photographs He was silent I believe it was my photographs that you threw away I didnt know what to do with them he cried and his voice was that of an anxious boy Her heart warmed towards him for the first time They were covered with blood There Im glad Ive told you and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them He pointed downstream Theyve gone The river swirled under the bridge I did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the seaI dont know I may just mean that they frightened me Then the boy verged into a man For something tremendous has happened I must face it without getting muddled It isnt exactly that a man has died Something warned Lucy that she must stop him It has happened he repeated and I mean to find out what it is Mr Emerson He turned towards her frowning as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest I want to ask you something before we go in They were close to their pension She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment He did likewise There is at times a magic in identity of position it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship She moved her elbows before saying I have behaved ridiculously He was following his own thoughts I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life I cannot think what came over me I nearly fainted myself he said but she felt that her attitude repelled him Well I owe you a thousand apologies Oh all right Andthis is the real pointyou know how silly people are gossipingladies especially I am afraidyou understand what I mean Im afraid I dont I mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour Your behaviour Oh yes all rightall right Thank you so much And would you She could not carry her request any further The river was rushing below them almost black in the advancing night He had thrown her photographs into it and then he had told her the reason It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man He would do her no harm by idle gossip he was trustworthy intelligent and even kind he might even have a high opinion of her But he lacked chivalry his thoughts like his behaviour would not be modified by awe It was useless to say to him And would you and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture She had been in his arms and he remembered it just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinaris shop It was not exactly that a man had died something had happened to the living they had come to a situation where character tells and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth Well thank you so much she repeated How quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life I dont Anxiety moved her to question him His answer was puzzling I shall probably want to live But why Mr Emerson What do you mean I shall want to live I say Leaning her elbows on the parapet she contemplated the River Arno whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucys adventure found the abridged account of it quite adequate and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr George Emerson She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back and the young officials there who seemed impudent and dsuvr had tried to search their reticules for provisions It might have been most unpleasant Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one For good or for evil Lucy was left to face her problem alone None of her friends had seen her either in the Piazza or later on by the embankment Mr Beebe indeed noticing her startled eyes at dinnertime had again passed to himself the remark of Too much Beethoven But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure not that she had encountered it This solitude oppressed her she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or at all events contradicted it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong At breakfast next morning she took decisive action There were two plans between which she had to choose Mr Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party Charlotte declined for herself she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy who hated shopping changing money fetching letters and other irksome dutiesall of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone No Charlotte cried the girl with real warmth Its very kind of Mr Beebe but I am certainly coming with you I had much rather Very well dear said Miss Bartlett with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy How abominably she behaved to Charlotte now as always But now she should alter All morning she would be really nice to her She slipped her arm into her cousins and they started off along the Lung Arno The river was a lion that morning in strength voice and colour Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it She then made her usual remark which was How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this too Lucy fidgeted it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did Look Lucia Oh you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party I feared you would repent you of your choice Serious as the choice had been Lucy did not repent Yesterday had been a muddlequeer and odd the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paperbut she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo Since she could not unravel the tangle she must take care not to reenter it She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartletts insinuations But though she had avoided the chief actor the scenery unfortunately remained Charlotte with the complacency of fate led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria She could not have believed that stones a Loggia a fountain a palace tower would have such significance For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts The exact site of the murder was occupied not by a ghost but by Miss Lavish who had the morning newspaper in her hand She hailed them briskly The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book Oh let me congratulate you said Miss Bartlett After your despair of yesterday What a fortunate thing Aha Miss Honeychurch come you here I am in luck Now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol But perhaps you would rather not Im sorryif you could manage without it I think I would rather not The elder ladies exchanged glances not of disapproval it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply It is I who am sorry said Miss Lavish literary hacks are shameless creatures I believe theres no secret of the human heart into which we wouldnt pry She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back and did a few calculations in realism Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight oclock collecting material A good deal of it was unsuitable but of course one always had to adapt The two men had quarrelled over a fivefranc note For the fivefranc note she should substitute a young lady which would raise the tone of the tragedy and at the same time furnish an excellent plot What is the heroines name asked Miss Bartlett Leonora said Miss Lavish her own name was Eleanor I do hope shes nice That desideratum would not be omitted And what is the plot Love murder abduction revenge was the plot But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this Miss Lavish concluded It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people Of course this is the barest outline There will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood and I shall also introduce some humorous characters And let me give you all fair warning I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist Oh you wicked woman cried Miss Bartlett I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen It is the neglected Italians who attract me and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can For I repeat and I insist and I have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterdays is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded Then the cousins wished success to her labours and walked slowly away across the square She is my idea of a really clever woman said Miss Bartlett That last remark struck me as so particularly true It should be a most pathetic novel Lucy assented At present her great aim was not to get put into it Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an ingenu She is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word continued Miss Bartlett slowly None but the superficial would be shocked at her We had a long talk yesterday She believes in justice and truth and human interest She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of womanMr Eager Why how nice What a pleasant surprise Ah not for me said the chaplain blandly for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time We were chatting to Miss Lavish His brow contracted So I saw Were you indeed Andate via sono occupato The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile I am about to venture a suggestion Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this weeka drive in the hills We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hours ramble on the hillside The view thence of Florence is most beautifulfar better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures That man had a decided feeling for landscape Decidedly But who looks at it today Ah the world is too much for us Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti but she knew that Mr Eager was no commonplace chaplain He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them Living in delicate seclusion some in furnished flats others in Renaissance villas on Fiesoles slope they read wrote studied and exchanged ideas thus attaining to that intimate knowledge or rather perception of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent Tea at a Renaissance villa Nothing had been said about it yet But if it did come to thathow Lucy would enjoy it A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew A drive in the hills with Mr Eager and Miss Bartletteven if culminating in a residential teapartywas no longer the greatest of them She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly Only when she heard that Mr Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere So we shall be a partie carre said the chaplain In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity Andate via andate presto presto Ah the town Beautiful as it is it is the town They assented This very squareso I am toldwitnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecrationportentous and humiliating Humiliating indeed said Miss Bartlett Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened She can hardly bear to speak of it She glanced at Lucy proudly And how came we to have you here asked the chaplain paternally Miss Bartletts recent liberalism oozed away at the question Do not blame her please Mr Eager The fault is mine I left her unchaperoned So you were here alone Miss Honeychurch His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable His dark handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply Practically One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home said Miss Bartlett adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver For her also it must have been a terrible experience I trust that neither of you was at allthat it was not in your immediate proximity Of the many things Lucy was noticing today not the least remarkable was this the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure He died by the fountain I believe was her reply And you and your friend Were over at the Loggia That must have saved you much You have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter PressThis man is a public nuisance he knows that I am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucyin the eternal league of Italy with youth He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr Eager binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches pictures and views This is too much cried the chaplain striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelicos angels She tore A shrill cry rose from the vendor The book it seemed was more valuable than one would have supposed Willingly would I purchase began Miss Bartlett Ignore him said Mr Eager sharply and they all walked rapidly away from the square But an Italian can never be ignored least of all when he has a grievance His mysterious persecution of Mr Eager became relentless the air rang with his threats and lamentations He appealed to Lucy would not she intercede He was poorhe sheltered a familythe tax on bread He waited he gibbered he was recompensed he was dissatisfied he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant Shopping was the topic that now ensued Under the chaplains guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoesflorid little pictureframes that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry other little frames more severe that stood on little easels and were carven out of oak a blotting book of vellum a Dante of the same material cheap mosaic brooches which the maids next Christmas would never tell from real pins pots heraldic saucers brown artphotographs Eros and Psyche in alabaster St Peter to matchall of which would have cost less in London This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy She had been a little frightened both by Miss Lavish and by Mr Eager she knew not why And as they frightened her she had strangely enough ceased to respect them She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist She doubted that Mr Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose They were tried by some new test and they were found wanting As for Charlotteas for Charlotte she was exactly the same It might be possible to be nice to her it was impossible to love her The son of a labourer I happen to know it for a fact A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press I came across him at Brixton They were talking about the Emersons How wonderfully people rise in these days sighed Miss Bartlett fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa Generally replied Mr Eager one has only sympathy for their success The desire for education and for social advancein these things there is something not wholly vile There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florencelittle as they would make of it Is he a journalist now Miss Bartlett asked He is not he made an advantageous marriage He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning and ended with a sigh Oh so he has a wife Dead Miss Bartlett dead I wonderyes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me He was in my London parish long ago The other day in Santa Croce when he was with Miss Honeychurch I snubbed him Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub What cried Lucy flushing Exposure hissed Mr Eager He tried to change the subject but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity Lucy though she wished never to see the Emersons again was not disposed to condemn them on a single word Do you mean she asked that he is an irreligious man We know that already Lucy dear said Miss Bartlett gently reproving her cousins penetration I should be astonished if you knew all The boyan innocent child at the timeI will exclude God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him Perhaps said Miss Bartlett it is something that we had better not hear To speak plainly said Mr Eager it is I will say no more For the first time Lucys rebellious thoughts swept out in wordsfor the first time in her life You have said very little It was my intention to say very little was his frigid reply He gazed indignantly at the girl who met him with equal indignation She turned towards him from the shop counter her breast heaved quickly He observed her brow and the sudden strength of her lips It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him Murder if you want to know he cried angrily That man murdered his wife How she retorted To all intents and purposes he murdered her That day in Santa Crocedid they say anything against me Not a word Mr Eagernot a single word Oh I thought they had been libelling me to you But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them Im not defending them said Lucy losing her courage and relapsing into the old chaotic methods Theyre nothing to me How could you think she was defending them said Miss Bartlett much discomfited by the unpleasant scene The shopman was possibly listening She will find it difficult For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God The addition of God was striking But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark A silence followed which might have been impressive but was merely awkward Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower and led the way into the street I must be going said he shutting his eyes and taking out his watch Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive Drive Oh is our drive to come off Lucy was recalled to her manners and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr Eager was restored Bother the drive exclaimed the girl as soon as he had departed It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr Beebe without any fuss at all Why should he invite us in that absurd manner We might as well invite him We are each paying for ourselves Miss Bartlett who had intended to lament over the Emersons was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts If that is so dearif the drive we and Mr Beebe are going with Mr Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr Beebe then I foresee a sad kettle of fish How Because Mr Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come too That will mean another carriage Far worse Mr Eager does not like Eleanor She knows it herself The truth must be told she is too unconventional for him They were now in the newspaperroom at the English bank Lucy stood by the central table heedless of Punch and the Graphic trying to answer or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain The wellknown world had broken up and there emerged Florence a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things Murder accusations of murder a lady clinging to one man and being rude to anotherwere these the daily incidents of her streets Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eyethe power perhaps to evoke passions good and bad and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment Happy Charlotte who though greatly troubled over things that did not matter seemed oblivious to things that did who could conjecture with admirable delicacy where things might lead to but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nosebag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank As she groped she murmured Whether it is Mr Beebe who forgot to tell Mr Eager or Mr Eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogetherwhich they could scarcely dobut in any case we must be prepared It is you they really want I am only asked for appearances You shall go with the two gentlemen and I and Eleanor will follow behind A onehorse carriage would do for us Yet how difficult it is It is indeed replied the girl with a gravity that sounded sympathetic What do you think about it asked Miss Bartlett flushed from the struggle and buttoning up her dress I dont know what I think nor what I want Oh dear Lucy I do hope Florence isnt boring you Speak the word and as you know I would take you to the ends of the earth tomorrow Thank you Charlotte said Lucy and pondered over the offer There were letters for her at the bureauone from her brother full of athletics and biology one from her mother delightful as only her mothers letters could be She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce of the new parlourmaid who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade of the semidetached cottages which were ruining Summer Street and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway She recalled the free pleasant life of her home where she was allowed to do everything and where nothing ever happened to her The road up through the pinewoods the clean drawingroom the view over the Sussex Wealdall hung before her bright and distinct but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which after much experience a traveller returns And the news asked Miss Bartlett Mrs Vyse and her son have gone to Rome said Lucy giving the news that interested her least Do you know the Vyses Oh not that way back We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria Theyre nice people the Vyses So clevermy idea of whats really clever Dont you long to be in Rome I die for it The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant It has no grass no flowers no frescoes no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick By an odd chanceunless we believe in a presiding genius of placesthe statues that relieve its severity suggest not the innocence of childhood nor the glorious bewilderment of youth but the conscious achievements of maturity Perseus and Judith Hercules and Thusnelda they have done or suffered something and though they are immortal immortality has come to them after experience not before Here not only in the solitude of Nature might a hero meet a goddess or a heroine a god Charlotte cried the girl suddenly Heres an idea What if we popped off to Rome tomorrowstraight to the Vyses hotel For I do know what I want Im sick of Florence No you said youd go to the ends of the earth Do Do Miss Bartlett with equal vivacity replied Oh you droll person Pray what would become of your drive in the hills They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square laughing over the unpractical suggestion Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe the Reverend Cuthbert Eager Mr Emerson Mr George Emerson Miss Eleanor Lavish Miss Charlotte Bartlett and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View Italians Drive Them It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day a youth all irresponsibility and fire recklessly urging his masters horses up the stony hill Mr Beebe recognized him at once Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way saying that she was his sisterPersephone tall and slender and pale returning with the Spring to her mothers cottage and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light To her Mr Eager objected saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge and one must guard against imposition But the ladies interceded and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist She did not mind Mr Eager who sat with his back to the horses saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding and continued his conversation with Lucy The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr Emerson and Miss Lavish For a dreadful thing had happened Mr Beebe without consulting Mr Eager had doubled the size of the party And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy while Miss Bartlett with George Emerson and Mr Beebe followed on behind It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carre thus transformed Tea at a Renaissance villa if he had ever meditated it was now impossible Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them and Mr Beebe though unreliable was a man of parts But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of Godthey should enter no villa at his introduction Lucy elegantly dressed in white sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients attentive to Mr Eager repressive towards Miss Lavish watchful of old Mr Emerson hitherto fortunately asleep thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy She had refused not because she disliked him but because she did not know what had happened and suspected that he did know And this frightened her For the real eventwhatever it washad taken place not in the Loggia but by the river To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable But to discuss it afterwards to pass from discussion into silence and through silence into sympathy that is an error not of a startled emotion but of the whole fabric There was really something blameworthy she thought in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word This sense of wickedness had been slight at first She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again And now celestial irony working through her cousin and two clergymen did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills Meanwhile Mr Eager held her in civil converse their little tiff was over So Miss Honeychurch you are travelling As a student of art Oh dear me nooh no Perhaps as a student of human nature interposed Miss Lavish like myself Oh no I am here as a tourist Oh indeed said Mr Eager Are you indeed If you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a littlehanded about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence from Florence to Rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else The result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl You know the American girl in Punch who says Say poppa what did we see at Rome And the father replies Why guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog Theres travelling for you Ha ha ha I quite agree said Miss Lavish who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit The narrowness and superficiality of the AngloSaxon tourist is nothing less than a menace Quite so Now the English colony at Florence Miss Honeychurchand it is of considerable size though of course not all equallya few are here for trade for example But the greater part are students Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left No you can only see it if you standno do not stand you will fall She is very proud of that thick hedge Inside perfect seclusion One might have gone back six hundred years Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not It does indeed cried Miss Lavish Tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day But Mr Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr Someone Something an American of the best typeso rareand that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of Medival Byways He is working at Gemistus Pletho Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and I thinkthinkI think how little they think what lies so near them During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully Lucy had a spasm of envy Granted that they wished to misbehave it was pleasant for them to be able to do so They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road Piano piano said Mr Eager elegantly waving his hand over his head Va bene signore va bene va bene crooned the driver and whipped his horses up again Now Mr Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti Was he a cause of the Renaissance or was he one of its manifestations The other carriage was left behind As the pace increased to a gallop the large slumbering form of Mr Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine Piano piano said he with a martyred look at Lucy An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat Phaethon who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone had just succeeded A little scene ensued which as Miss Bartlett said afterwards was most unpleasant The horses were stopped the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves the boy was to lose his pourboire the girl was immediately to get down She is my sister said he turning round on them with piteous eyes Mr Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar Phaethon hung down his head not at the matter of the accusation but at its manner At this point Mr Emerson whom the shock of stopping had awoke declared that the lovers must on no account be separated and patted them on the back to signify his approval And Miss Lavish though unwilling to ally him felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism Most certainly I would let them be she cried But I dare say I shall receive scant support I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life This is what I call an adventure We must not submit said Mr Eager I knew he was trying it on He is treating us as if we were a party of Cooks tourists Surely no said Miss Lavish her ardour visibly decreasing The other carriage had drawn up behind and sensible Mr Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly Leave them alone Mr Emerson begged the chaplain of whom he stood in no awe Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there To be driven by loversA king might envy us and if we part them its more like sacrilege than anything I know Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect Mr Eager who suffered from an overfluent tongue rather than a resolute will was determined to make himself heard He addressed the driver again Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deepvoiced stream with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony In Mr Eagers mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher and quicker and quicker and more and more shrilly till abruptly it was turned off with a click Signorina said the man to Lucy when the display had ceased Why should he appeal to Lucy Signorina echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto She pointed at the other carriage Why For a moment the two girls looked at each other Then Persephone got down from the box Victory at last said Mr Eager smiting his hands together as the carriages started again It is not victory said Mr Emerson It is defeat You have parted two people who were happy Mr Eager shut his eyes He was obliged to sit next to Mr Emerson but he would not speak to him The old man was refreshed by sleep and took up the matter warmly He commanded Lucy to agree with him he shouted for support to his son We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money He has bargained to drive us and he is doing it We have no rights over his soul Miss Lavish frowned It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character He was not driving us well she said He jolted us That I deny It was as restful as sleeping Aha he is jolting us now Can you wonder He would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified And if I were superstitious Id be frightened of the girl too It doesnt do to injure young people Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici Miss Lavish bristled Most certainly I have Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico or to Lorenzo Duke of Urbino or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature The Lord knows Possibly he does know for I refer to Lorenzo the poet He wrote a lineso I heard yesterdaywhich runs like this Dont go fighting against the Spring Mr Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition Non fate guerra al Maggio he murmured War not with the May would render a correct meaning The point is we have warred with it Look He pointed to the Val dArno which was visible far below them through the budding trees Fifty miles of Spring and weve come up to admire them Do you suppose theres any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man But there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both No one encouraged him to talk Presently Mr Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill A hollow like a great amphitheatre full of terraced steps and misty olives now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole and the road still following its curve was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain It was this promontory uncultivated wet covered with bushes and occasional trees which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before He had ascended it that diligent and rather obscure master possibly with an eye to business possibly for the joy of ascending Standing there he had seen that view of the Val dArno and distant Florence which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work But where exactly had he stood That was the question which Mr Eager hoped to solve now And Miss Lavish whose nature was attracted by anything problematical had become equally enthusiastic But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head even if you have remembered to look at them before starting And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions Finally they split into groups Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers while the two clergymen who were expected to have topics in common were left to each other The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss not Alessio Baldovinetti but the drive Miss Bartlett had asked Mr George Emerson what his profession was and he had answered the railway She was very sorry that she had asked him She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer or she would not have asked him Mr Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him The railway gasped Miss Lavish Oh but I shall die Of course it was the railway She could not control her mirth He is the image of a porteron on the SouthEastern Eleanor be quiet plucking at her vivacious companion Hush Theyll hearthe Emersons I cant stop Let me go my wicked way A porter Eleanor Im sure its all right put in Lucy The Emersons wont hear and they wouldnt mind if they did Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this Miss Honeychurch listening she said rather crossly Pouf Wouf You naughty girl Go away Oh Lucy you ought to be with Mr Eager Im sure I cant find them now and I dont want to either Mr Eager will be offended It is your party Please Id rather stop here with you No I agree said Miss Lavish Its like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls Miss Lucy you are to go We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear The girl was stubborn As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent Such a one was Miss Lavish and such for the moment was Charlotte She wished she had not called attention to herself they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her How tired one gets said Miss Bartlett Oh I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm Lucy did not look at the view either She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome Then sit you down said Miss Lavish Observe my foresight With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps She sat on one who was to sit on the other Lucy without a moments doubt Lucy The ground will do for me Really I have not had rheumatism for years If I do feel it coming on I shall stand Imagine your mothers feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist Here we are all settled delightfully Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown Sit down dear you are too unselfish you dont assert yourself enough She cleared her throat Now dont be alarmed this isnt a cold Its the tiniest cough and I have had it three days Its nothing to do with sitting here at all There was only one way of treating the situation At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr Beebe and Mr Eager vanquished by the mackintosh square She addressed herself to the drivers who were sprawling in the carriages perfuming the cushions with cigars The miscreant a bony young man scorched black by the sun rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative Dove said Lucy after much anxious thought His face lit up Of course he knew where Not so far either His arm swept threefourths of the horizon He should just think he did know where He pressed his fingertips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge More seemed necessary What was the Italian for clergyman Dove buoni uomini said she at last Good Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings He showed her his cigar Unopiupiccolo was her next remark implying Has the cigar been given to you by Mr Beebe the smaller of the two good men She was correct as usual He tied the horse to a tree kicked it to make it stay quiet dusted the carriage arranged his hair remoulded his hat encouraged his moustache and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her Italians are born knowing the way It would seem that the whole earth lay before them not as a map but as a chessboard whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares Any one can find places but the finding of people is a gift from God He only stopped once to pick her some great blue violets She thanked him with real pleasure In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct For the first time she felt the influence of Spring His arm swept the horizon gracefully violets like other things existed in great profusion there would she like to see them Ma buoni uomini He bowed Certainly Good men first violets afterwards They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth which became thicker and thicker They were nearing the edge of the promontory and the view was stealing round them but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces He was occupied in his cigar and in holding back the pliant boughs She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness Not a step not a twig was unimportant to her What is that There was a voice in the wood in the distance behind them The voice of Mr Eager He shrugged his shoulders An Italians ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen The view was forming at last she could discern the river the golden plain other hills Eccolo he exclaimed At the same moment the ground gave way and with a cry she fell out of the wood Light and beauty enveloped her She had fallen on to a little open terrace which was covered with violets from end to end Courage cried her companion now standing some six feet above Courage and love She did not answer From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts irrigating the hillside with blue eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows covering the grass with spots of azure foam But never again were they in such profusion this terrace was the wellhead the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth Standing at its brink like a swimmer who prepares was the good man But he was not the good man that she had expected and he was alone George had turned at the sound of her arrival For a moment he contemplated her as one who had fallen out of heaven He saw radiant joy in her face he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves The bushes above them closed He stepped quickly forward and kissed her Before she could speak almost before she could feel a voice called Lucy Lucy Lucy The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon What it was and exactly how the players had sided Lucy was slow to discover Mr Eager had met them with a questioning eye Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk Mr Emerson seeking his son was told whereabouts to find him Mr Beebe who wore the heated aspect of a neutral was bidden to collect the factions for the return home There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment Pan had been amongst themnot the great god Pan who has been buried these two thousand years but the little god Pan who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics Mr Beebe had lost everyone and had consumed in solitude the teabasket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett Lucy had lost Mr Eager Mr Emerson had lost George Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square Phaethon had lost the game That last fact was undeniable He climbed on to the box shivering with his collar up prophesying the swift approach of bad weather Let us go immediately he told them The signorino will walk All the way He will be hours said Mr Beebe Apparently I told him it was unwise He would look no one in the face perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him He alone had played skilfully using the whole of his instinct while the others had used scraps of their intelligence He alone had divined what things were and what he wished them to be He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man Persephone who spends half her life in the graveshe could interpret it also Not so these English They gain knowledge slowly and perhaps too late The thoughts of a cabdriver however just seldom affect the lives of his employers He was the most competent of Miss Bartletts opponents but infinitely the least dangerous Once back in the town he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more Of course it was most unpleasant she had seen his black head in the bushes he might make a tavern story out of it But after all what have we to do with taverns Real menace belongs to the drawingroom It was of drawingroom people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun Lucy sat beside her Mr Eager sat opposite trying to catch her eye he was vaguely suspicious They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti Rain and darkness came on together The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol There was a lightning flash and Miss Lavish who was nervous screamed from the carriage in front At the next flash Lucy screamed also Mr Eager addressed her professionally Courage Miss Honeychurch courage and faith If I might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me Noof course Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous The steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage And in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking Couragecourage and faith Under the rug Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousins hand At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards Miss Bartlett by this timely exercise of her muscles gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination She renewed it when the two carriages stopped half into Florence Mr Eager called Mr Beebe We want your assistance Will you interpret for us George cried Mr Emerson Ask your driver which way George went The boy may lose his way He may be killed Go Mr Eager said Miss Bartlett dont ask our driver our driver is no help Go and support poor Mr Beebe he is nearly demented He may be killed cried the old man He may be killed Typical behaviour said the chaplain as he quitted the carriage In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down What does he know whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone Charlotte how much does Mr Eager know Nothing dearest he knows nothing But she pointed at the driverhe knows everything Dearest had we better Shall I She took out her purse It is dreadful to be entangled with lowclass people He saw it all Tapping Phaethons back with her guidebook she said Silenzio and offered him a franc Va bene he replied and accepted it As well this ending to his day as any But Lucy a mortal maid was disappointed in him There was an explosion up the road The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline and one of the great supports had fallen If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation and the floods of love and sincerity which fructify every hour of life burst forth in tumult They descended from the carriages they embraced each other It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good The older people recovered quickly In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike Miss Lavish calculated that even if they had continued they would not have been caught in the accident Mr Eager mumbled a temperate prayer But the drivers through miles of dark squalid road poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin Charlotte dear Charlotte kiss me Kiss me again Only you can understand me You warned me to be careful And II thought I was developing Do not cry dearest Take your time I have been obstinate and sillyworse than you know far worse Once by the riverOh but he isnt killedhe wouldnt be killed would he The thought disturbed her repentance As a matter of fact the storm was worst along the road but she had been near danger and so she thought it must be near to everyone I trust not One would always pray against that He is reallyI think he was taken by surprise just as I was before But this time Im not to blame I want you to believe that I simply slipped into those violets No I want to be really truthful I am a little to blame I had silly thoughts The sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book In a book Heroesgodsthe nonsense of schoolgirls And then But Charlotte you know what happened then Miss Bartlett was silent Indeed she had little more to learn With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her All the way back Lucys body was shaken by deep sighs which nothing could repress I want to be truthful she whispered It is so hard to be absolutely truthful Dont be troubled dearest Wait till you are calmer We will talk it over before bedtime in my room So they reentered the city with hands clasped It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others The storm had ceased and Mr Emerson was easier about his son Mr Beebe had regained good humour and Mr Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish Charlotte alone she was sure ofCharlotte whose exterior concealed so much insight and love The luxury of selfexposure kept her almost happy through the long evening She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it All her sensations her spasms of courage her moments of unreasonable joy her mysterious discontent should be carefully laid before her cousin And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all At last thought she I shall understand myself I shant again be troubled by things that come out of nothing and mean I dont know what Miss Alan asked her to play She refused vehemently Music seemed to her the employment of a child She sat close to her cousin who with commendable patience was listening to a long story about lost luggage When it was over she capped it by a story of her own Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay In vain she tried to check or at all events to accelerate the tale It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach Well dear I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire Come into my room and I will give a good brush to your hair With some solemnity the door was shut and a cane chair placed for the girl Then Miss Bartlett said So what is to be done She was unprepared for the question It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon What is to be done A point dearest which you alone can settle The rain was streaming down the black windows and the great room felt damp and chilly One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartletts toque which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door A tram roared by in the dark and Lucy felt unaccountably sad though she had long since dried her eyes She lifted them to the ceiling where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague the very ghosts of joy It has been raining for nearly four hours she said at last Miss Bartlett ignored the remark How do you propose to silence him The driver My dear girl no Mr George Emerson Lucy began to pace up and down the room I dont understand she said at last She understood very well but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful How are you going to stop him talking about it I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do I too intend to judge him charitably But unfortunately I have met the type before They seldom keep their exploits to themselves Exploits cried Lucy wincing under the horrible plural My poor dear did you suppose that this was his first Come here and listen to me I am only gathering it from his own remarks Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another Yes said Lucy whom at the time the argument had pleased Well I am no prude There is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish But we are no farther on with our question What do you propose to do An idea rushed across Lucys brain which had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her might have proved victorious I propose to speak to him said she Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm You see Charlotte your kindnessI shall never forget it Butas you saidit is my affair Mine and his And you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence Certainly not There would be no difficulty Whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over I have been frightened of him But now I am not one little bit But we fear him for you dear You are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can behow they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round This afternoon for example if I had not arrived what would have happened I cant think said Lucy gravely Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question intoning it more vigorously What would have happened if I hadnt arrived I cant think said Lucy again When he insulted you how would you have replied I hadnt time to think You came Yes but wont you tell me now what you would have done I should have She checked herself and broke the sentence off She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness She could not think what she would have done Come away from the window dear said Miss Bartlett You will be seen from the road Lucy obeyed She was in her cousins power She could not modulate out the key of selfabasement in which she had started Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter whatever it was with him Miss Bartlett became plaintive Oh for a real man We are only two women you and I Mr Beebe is hopeless There is Mr Eager but you do not trust him Oh for your brother He is young but I know that his sisters insult would rouse in him a very lion Thank God chivalry is not yet dead There are still left some men who can reverence woman As she spoke she pulled off her rings of which she wore several and ranged them upon the pin cushion Then she blew into her gloves and said It will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try What train The train to Rome She looked at her gloves critically The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given When does the train to Rome go At eight Signora Bertolini would be upset We must face that said Miss Bartlett not liking to say that she had given notice already She will make us pay for a whole weeks pension I expect she will However we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses hotel Isnt afternoon tea given there for nothing Yes but they pay extra for wine After this remark she remained motionless and silent To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream They began to sort their clothes for packing for there was no time to lose if they were to catch the train to Rome Lucy when admonished began to move to and fro between the rooms more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill Charlotte who was practical without ability knelt by the side of an empty trunk vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size She gave two or three sighs for the stooping posture hurt her back and for all her diplomacy she felt that she was growing old The girl heard her as she entered the room and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause She only felt that the candle would burn better the packing go easier the world be happier if she could give and receive some human love The impulse had come before today but never so strongly She knelt down by her cousins side and took her in her arms Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth But she was not a stupid woman and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her but needed her to love For it was in ominous tones that she said after a long pause Dearest Lucy how will you ever forgive me Lucy was on her guard at once knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant Her emotion relaxed she modified her embrace a little and she said Charlotte dear what do you mean As if I have anything to forgive You have a great deal and I have a very great deal to forgive myself too I know well how much I vex you at every turn But no Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role that of the prematurely aged martyr Ah but yes I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped I might have known it would not do You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you I am too uninteresting and oldfashionedonly fit to pack and unpack your things Please My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary You had your own way about these rooms at all events You mustnt say these things said Lucy softly She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other heart and soul They continued to pack in silence I have been a failure said Miss Bartlett as she struggled with the straps of Lucys trunk instead of strapping her own Failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother She has been so generous to me I shall never face her again after this disaster But mother will understand It is not your fault this trouble and it isnt a disaster either It is my fault it is a disaster She will never forgive me and rightly For instance what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish Every right When I was here for your sake If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you Your mother will see this as clearly as I do when you tell her Lucy from a cowardly wish to improve the situation said Why need mother hear of it But you tell her everything I suppose I do generally I dare not break your confidence There is something sacred in it Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her The girl would not be degraded to this Naturally I should have told her But in case she should blame you in any way I promise I will not I am very willing not to I will never speak of it either to her or to any one Her promise brought the longdrawn interview to a sudden close Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks wished her goodnight and sent her to her own room For a moment the original trouble was in the background George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him she did not pass judgement At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousins voice had intervened and ever since it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated Miss Bartlett who even now could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall Miss Bartlett who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent She had worked like a great artist for a timeindeed for yearsshe had been meaningless but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn bettera shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil but which do not seem to bring good if we may judge from those who have used them most Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity of her craving for sympathy and love Such a wrong is not easily forgotten Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul The doorbell rang and she started to the shutters Before she reached them she hesitated turned and blew out the candle Thus it was that though she saw someone standing in the wet below he though he looked up did not see her To reach his room he had to go by hers She was still dressed It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up and that their extraordinary intercourse was over Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door and her voice said I wish one word with you in the drawingroom Mr Emerson please Soon their footsteps returned and Miss Bartlett said Goodnight Mr Emerson His heavy tired breathing was the only reply the chaperon had done her work Lucy cried aloud It isnt true It cant all be true I want not to be muddled I want to grow older quickly Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall Go to bed at once dear You need all the rest you can get In the morning they left for Rome PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawingroom curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun They were heavy curtains reaching almost to the ground and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied A poetnone was presentmight have quoted Life like a dome of many coloured glass or might have compared the curtains to sluicegates lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven Without was poured a sea of radiance within the glory though visible was tempered to the capacities of man Two pleasant people sat in the room Onea boy of nineteenwas studying a small manual of anatomy and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned for the day was hot and the print small and the human frame fearfully made and his mother who was writing a letter did continually read out to him what she had written And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet and make the remark that they were still there Where arent they said the boy who was Freddy Lucys brother I tell you Im getting fairly sick For goodness sake go out of my drawingroom then cried Mrs Honeychurch who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally Freddy did not move or reply I think things are coming to a head she observed rather wanting her sons opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication Time they did I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more Its his third go isnt it Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind I didnt mean to be unkind Then he added But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy I dont know how girls manage things but she cant have said No properly before or she wouldnt have to say it again now Over the whole thingI cant explainI do feel so uncomfortable Do you indeed dear How interesting I feelnever mind He returned to his work Just listen to what I have written to Mrs Vyse I said Dear Mrs Vyse Yes mother you told me A jolly good letter I said Dear Mrs Vyse Cecil has just asked my permission about it and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it But She stopped reading I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all He has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth When it comes to the point he cant get on without me Nor me You Freddy nodded What do you mean He asked me for my permission also She exclaimed How very odd of him Why so asked the son and heir Why shouldnt my permission be asked What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything What ever did you say I said to Cecil Take her or leave her its no business of mine What a helpful answer But her own answer though more normal in its wording had been to the same effect The bother is this began Freddy Then he took up his work again too shy to say what the bother was Mrs Honeychurch went back to the window Freddy you must come There they still are I dont see you ought to go peeping like that Peeping like that Cant I look out of my own window But she returned to the writingtable observing as she passed her son Still page 322 Freddy snorted and turned over two leaves For a brief space they were silent Close by beyond the curtains the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased The bother is this I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully He gave a nervous gulp Not content with permission which I did givethat is to say I said I dont mindwell not content with that he wanted to know whether I wasnt off my head with joy He practically put it like this Wasnt it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her And he would have an answerhe said it would strengthen his hand I hope you gave a careful answer dear I answered No said the boy grinding his teeth There Fly into a stew I cant help ithad to say it I had to say no He ought never to have asked me Ridiculous child cried his mother You think youre so holy and truthful but really its only abominable conceit Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say I hope he boxed your ears How dare you say no Oh do keep quiet mother I had to say no when I couldnt say yes I tried to laugh as if I didnt mean what I said and as Cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right But I feel my foots in it Oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work No said Mrs Honeychurch with the air of one who has considered the subject I shall not keep quiet You know all that has passed between them in Rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house Not a bit he pleaded I only let out I didnt like him I dont hate him but I dont like him What I mind is that hell tell Lucy He glanced at the curtains dismally Well I like him said Mrs Honeychurch I know his mother hes good hes clever hes rich hes well connectedOh you neednt kick the piano Hes well connectedIll say it again if you like hes well connected She paused as if rehearsing her eulogy but her face remained dissatisfied She added And he has beautiful manners I liked him till just now I suppose its having him spoiling Lucys first week at home and its also something that Mr Beebe said not knowing Mr Beebe said his mother trying to conceal her interest I dont see how Mr Beebe comes in You know Mr Beebes funny way when you never quite know what he means He said Mr Vyse is an ideal bachelor I was very cute I asked him what he meant He said Oh hes like mebetter detached I couldnt make him say any more but it set me thinking Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasnt been so pleasant at leastI cant explain You never can dear But I can You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties The explanation seemed plausible and Freddy tried to accept it But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust Cecil praised one too much for being athletic Was that it Cecil made one talk in ones own way This tired one Was that it And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellows cap Unaware of his own profundity Freddy checked himself He must be jealous or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons Will this do called his mother Dear Mrs VyseCecil has just asked my permission about it and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it Then I put in at the top and I have told Lucy so I must write the letter out againand I have told Lucy so But Lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves I said that because I didnt want Mrs Vyse to think us oldfashioned She goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maids dirty thumbmarks where you turn on the electric light She keeps that flat abominably Suppose Lucy marries Cecil would she live in a flat or in the country Dont interrupt so foolishly Where was I Oh yesYoung people must decide for themselves I know that Lucy likes your son because she tells me everything and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first No Ill cross that last bit outit looks patronizing Ill stop at because she tells me everything Or shall I cross that out too Cross it out too said Freddy Mrs Honeychurch left it in Then the whole thing runs Dear Mrs VyseCecil has just asked my permission about it and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it and I have told Lucy so But Lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves I know that Lucy likes your son because she tells me everything But I do not know Look out cried Freddy The curtains parted Cecils first movement was one of irritation He couldnt bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch and sent them swinging down their poles Light entered There was revealed a terrace such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it and on it a little rustic seat and two flowerbeds But it was transfigured by the view beyond for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald Lucy who was in the little seat seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world Cecil entered Appearing thus late in the story Cecil must be at once described He was medieval Like a Gothic statue Tall and refined with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral Well educated well endowed and not deficient physically he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as selfconsciousness and whom the medieval with dimmer vision worshipped as asceticism A Gothic statue implies celibacy just as a Greek statue implies fruition and perhaps this was what Mr Beebe meant And Freddy who ignored history and art perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellows cap Mrs Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance Oh Cecil she exclaimedoh Cecil do tell me I promessi sposi said he They stared at him anxiously She has accepted me he said and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure and look more human I am so glad said Mrs Honeychurch while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals They wished that they also knew Italian for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones We are obliged to become vaguely poetic or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences Welcome as one of the family said Mrs Honeychurch waving her hand at the furniture This is indeed a joyous day I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy I hope so replied the young man shifting his eyes to the ceiling We mothers simpered Mrs Honeychurch and then realized that she was affected sentimental bombasticall the things she hated most Why could she not be Freddy who stood stiff in the middle of the room looking very cross and almost handsome I say Lucy called Cecil for conversation seemed to flag Lucy rose from the seat She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis Then she saw her brothers face Her lips parted and she took him in her arms He said Steady on Not a kiss for me asked her mother Lucy kissed her also Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs Honeychurch all about it Cecil suggested And Id stop here and tell my mother We go with Lucy said Freddy as if taking orders Yes you go with Lucy They passed into the sunlight Cecil watched them cross the terrace and descend out of sight by the steps They would descendhe knew their wayspast the shrubbery and past the tennislawn and the dahliabed until they reached the kitchen garden and there in the presence of the potatoes and the peas the great event would be discussed Smiling indulgently he lit a cigarette and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion He had known Lucy for several years but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue and demanded to be taken to St Peters That day she had seemed a typical touristshrill crude and gaunt with travel But Italy worked some marvel in her It gave her light andwhich he held more preciousit gave her shadow Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vincis whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us The things are assuredly not of this life no woman of Leonardos could have anything so vulgar as a story She did develop most wonderfully day by day So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion at least to a profound uneasiness Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion Her refusal had been clear and gentle after itas the horrid phrase wentshe had been exactly the same to him as before Three months later on the margin of Italy among the flowerclad Alps he had asked her again in bald traditional language She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her He walked home with her unashamed feeling not at all like a rejected suitor The things that really mattered were unshaken So now he had asked her once more and clear and gentle as ever she had accepted him giving no coy reasons for her delay but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy His mother too would be pleased she had counselled the step he must write her a long account Glancing at his hand in case any of Freddys chemicals had come off on it he moved to the writing table There he saw Dear Mrs Vyse followed by many erasures He recoiled without reading any more and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere and pencilled a note on his knee Then he lit another cigarette which did not seem quite as divine as the first and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawingroom more distinctive With that outlook it should have been a successful room but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it he could almost visualize the motorvans of Messrs Shoolbred and Messrs Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair those varnished bookcases that writingtable The table recalled Mrs Honeychurchs letter He did not want to read that letterhis temptations never lay in that direction but he worried about it none the less It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy he wanted to feel that others no matter who they were agreed with him and so he had asked their permission Mrs Honeychurch had been civil but obtuse in essentials while as for FreddyHe is only a boy he reflected I represent all that he despises Why should he want me for a brotherinlaw The Honeychurches were a worthy family but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay and perhapshe did not put it very definitelyhe ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible Mr Beebe said the maid and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in he had at once started on friendly relations owing to Lucys praise of him in her letters from Florence Cecil greeted him rather critically Ive come for tea Mr Vyse Do you suppose that I shall get it I should say so Food is the thing one does get hereDont sit in that chair young Honeychurch has left a bone in it Pfui I know said Cecil I know I cant think why Mrs Honeychurch allows it For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples furniture separately he did not realize that taken together they kindled the room into the life that he desired Ive come for tea and for gossip Isnt this news News I dont understand you said Cecil News Mr Beebe whose news was of a very different nature prattled forward I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr Flack Has he indeed said Cecil trying to recover himself Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant But his stiffness remained and though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be he still thought Mr Beebe rather a bounder Unpardonable question To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert the semidetached villas that have been run up opposite the church Ill set Mrs Honeychurch after you Im shockingly stupid over local affairs said the young man languidly I cant even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board Perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those arent the right names I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery It is very remiss of me Italy and London are the only places where I dont feel to exist on sufferance Mr Beebe distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert determined to shift the subject Let me see Mr VyseI forgetwhat is your profession I have no profession said Cecil It is another example of my decadence My attitudequite an indefensible oneis that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like I know I ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things I dont care a straw about but somehow Ive not been able to begin You are very fortunate said Mr Beebe It is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure His voice was rather parochial but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally He felt as all who have regular occupation must feel that others should have it also I am glad that you approve I darent face the healthy personfor example Freddy Honeychurch Oh Freddys a good sort isnt he Admirable The sort who has made England what she is Cecil wondered at himself Why on this day of all others was he so hopelessly contrary He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr Beebes mother an old lady for whom he had no particular regard Then he flattered the clergyman praised his liberalmindedness his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science Where are the others said Mr Beebe at last I insist on extracting tea before evening service I suppose Anne never told them you were here In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chairlegs with her feet The faults of MaryI forget the faults of Mary but they are very grave Shall we look in the garden I know the faults of Mary She leaves the dustpans standing on the stairs The fault of Euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small They both laughed and things began to go better The faults of Freddy Cecil continued Ah he has too many No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch they are not innumerable She has none said the young man with grave sincerity I quite agree At present she has none At present Im not cynical Im only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both The watertight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle Then we shall have her heroically good heroically badtoo heroic perhaps to be good or bad Cecil found his companion interesting And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes Well I must say Ive only seen her at Tunbridge Wells where she was not wonderful and at Florence Since I came to Summer Street she has been away You saw her didnt you at Rome and in the Alps Oh I forgot of course you knew her before No she wasnt wonderful in Florence either but I kept on expecting that she would be In what way Conversation had become agreeable to them and they were pacing up and down the terrace I could as easily tell you what tune shell play next There was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary Miss Honeychurch as a kite Miss Bartlett holding the string Picture number two the string breaks The sketch was in his diary but it had been made afterwards when he viewed things artistically At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself But the string never broke No I mightnt have seen Miss Honeychurch rise but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall It has broken now said the young man in low vibrating tones Immediately he realized that of all the conceited ludicrous contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst He cursed his love of metaphor had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him Broken What do you mean I meant said Cecil stiffly that she is going to marry me The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice I am sorry I must apologize I had no idea you were intimate with her or I should never have talked in this flippant superficial way Mr Vyse you ought to have stopped me And down the garden he saw Lucy herself yes he was disappointed Cecil who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies drew down his mouth at the corners Was this the reception his action would get from the world Of course he despised the world as a whole every thoughtful man should it is almost a test of refinement But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered Occasionally he could be quite crude I am sorry I have given you a shock he said dryly I fear that Lucys choice does not meet with your approval Not that But you ought to have stopped me I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes Perhaps I oughtnt to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you You are conscious of having said something indiscreet Mr Beebe pulled himself together Really Mr Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession No I have said nothing indiscreet I foresaw at Florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step She has taken it She has learntyou will let me talk freely as I have begun freelyshe has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio He did not omit to do so She has learnt through you and if his voice was still clerical it was now also sincere let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her Grazie tante said Cecil who did not like parsons Have you heard shouted Mrs Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden Oh Mr Beebe have you heard the news Freddy now full of geniality whistled the wedding march Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact Indeed I have he cried He looked at Lucy In her presence he could not act the parson any longerat all events not without apology Mrs Honeychurch Im going to do what I am always supposed to do but generally Im too shy I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother And now I want my tea You only asked for it just in time the lady retorted How dare you be serious at Windy Corner He took his tone from her There was no more heavy beneficence no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures None of them dared or was able to be serious any more An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe Away from it in the solitude of their rooms Mr Beebe and even Freddy might again be critical But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious It has a strange power for it compels not only the lips but the very heart The chief parallel to compare one great thing with anotheris the power over us of a temple of some alien creed Standing outside we deride or oppose it or at the most feel sentimental Inside though the saints and gods are not ours we become true believers in case any true believer should be present So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant teaparty If they were hypocrites they did not know it and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true Anne putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present stimulated them greatly They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawingroom door Mr Beebe chirruped Freddy was at his wittiest referring to Cecil as the Fiascofamily honoured pun on fiance Mrs Honeychurch amusing and portly promised well as a motherinlaw As for Lucy and Cecil for whom the temple had been built they also joined in the merry ritual but waited as earnest worshippers should for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little gardenparty in the neighbourhood for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man Cecil was more than presentable he looked distinguished and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy and his long fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him People congratulated Mrs Honeychurch which is I believe a social blunder but it pleased her and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers At tea a misfortune took place a cup of coffee was upset over Lucys figured silk and though Lucy feigned indifference her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid They were gone some time and Cecil was left with the dowagers When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been Do you go to much of this sort of thing he asked when they were driving home Oh now and then said Lucy who had rather enjoyed herself Is it typical of country society I suppose so Mother would it be Plenty of society said Mrs Honeychurch who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere Cecil bent towards Lucy and said To me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous I am so sorry that you were stranded Not that but the congratulations It is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public propertya kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment All those old women smirking One has to go through it I suppose They wont notice us so much next time But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong An engagementhorrid word in the first placeis a private matter and should be treated as such Yet the smirking old women however wrong individually were racially correct The spirit of the generations had smiled through them rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite differentpersonal love Hence Cecils irritation and Lucys belief that his irritation was just How tiresome she said Couldnt you have escaped to tennis I dont play tennisat least not in public The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato Inglese Italianato E un diavolo incarnato You know the proverb She did not Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother But Cecil since his engagement had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing Well said he I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and I must accept them We all have our limitations I suppose said wise Lucy Sometimes they are forced on us though said Cecil who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position How It makes a difference doesnt it whether we fully fence ourselves in or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others She thought a moment and agreed that it did make a difference Difference cried Mrs Honeychurch suddenly alert I dont see any difference Fences are fences especially when they are in the same place We were speaking of motives said Cecil on whom the interruption jarred My dear Cecil look here She spread out her knees and perched her cardcase on her lap This is me Thats Windy Corner The rest of the pattern is the other people Motives are all very well but the fence comes here We werent talking of real fences said Lucy laughing Oh I see dearpoetry She leant placidly back Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused I tell you who has no fences as you call them she said and thats Mr Beebe A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless Lucy was slow to follow what people said but quick enough to detect what they meant She missed Cecils epigram but grasped the feeling that prompted it Dont you like Mr Beebe she asked thoughtfully I never said so he cried I consider him far above the average I only denied And he swept off on the subject of fences again and was brilliant Now a clergyman that I do hate said she wanting to say something sympathetic a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is Mr Eager the English chaplain at Florence He was truly insincerenot merely the manner unfortunate He was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things What sort of things There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife Perhaps he had No Why no He was such a nice old man Im sure Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence Well I did try to sift the thing Mr Eager would never come to the point He prefers it vaguesaid the old man had practically murdered his wifehad murdered her in the sight of God Hush dear said Mrs Honeychurch absently But isnt it intolerable that a person whom were told to imitate should go round spreading slander It was I believe chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped People pretended he was vulgar but he certainly wasnt that Poor old man What was his name Harris said Lucy glibly Lets hope that Mrs Harris there warnt no sich person said her mother Cecil nodded intelligently Isnt Mr Eager a parson of the cultured type he asked I dont know I hate him Ive heard him lecture on Giotto I hate him Nothing can hide a petty nature I hate him My goodness gracious me child said Mrs Honeychurch Youll blow my head off Whatever is there to shout over I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen He smiled There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucys moral outburst over Mr Eager It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation that a womans power and charm reside in mystery not in muscular rant But possibly rant is a sign of vitality it mars the beautiful creature but shows that she is alive After a moment he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval He forebore to repress the sources of youth Naturesimplest of topics he thoughtlay around them He praised the pinewoods the deep lasts of bracken the crimson leaves that spotted the hurtbushes the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road The outdoor world was not very familiar to him and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact Mrs Honeychurchs mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch I count myself a lucky person he concluded When Im in London I feel I could never live out of it When Im in the country I feel the same about the country After all I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best Its true that in nine cases out of ten they dont seem to notice anything The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town Do you feel that Mrs Honeychurch Mrs Honeychurch started and smiled She had not been attending Cecil who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria felt irritable and determined not to say anything interesting again Lucy had not attended either Her brow was wrinkled and she still looked furiously crossthe result he concluded of too much moral gymnastics It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood Come down O maid from yonder mountain height he quoted and touched her knee with his own She flushed again and said What height Come down O maid from yonder mountain height What pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang In height and in the splendour of the hills Let us take Mrs Honeychurchs advice and hate clergymen no more Whats this place Summer Street of course said Lucy and roused herself The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow Pretty cottages lined it on two sides and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church expensively simple a charming shingled spire Mr Beebes house was near the church In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages Some great mansions were at hand but they were hidden in the trees The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world and was marred only by two ugly little villasthe villas that had competed with Cecils engagement having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil Cissie was the name of one of these villas Albert of the other These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates but appeared a second time on the porches where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals Albert was inhabited His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace Cissie was to let Three noticeboards belonging to Dorking agents lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact Her paths were already weedy her pockethandkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions The place is ruined said the ladies mechanically Summer Street will never be the same again As the carriage passed Cissies door opened and a gentleman came out of her Stop cried Mrs Honeychurch touching the coachman with her parasol Heres Sir Harry Now we shall know Sir Harry pull those things down at once Sir Harry Otwaywho need not be describedcame to the carriage and said Mrs Honeychurch I meant to I cant I really cant turn out Miss Flack Am I not always right She ought to have gone before the contract was signed Does she still live rent free as she did in her nephews time But what can I do He lowered his voice An old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden Turn her out said Cecil bravely Sir Harry sighed and looked at the villas mournfully He had had full warning of Mr Flacks intentions and might have bought the plot before building commenced but he was apathetic and dilatory He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt Not till Mrs Flack had laid the foundation stone and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm He called on Mr Flack the local buildera most reasonable and respectful manwho agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof but pointed out that slates were cheaper He ventured to differ however about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows saying that for his part he liked to relieve the faade by a bit of decoration Sir Harry hinted that a column if possible should be structural as well as decorative Mr Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered adding and all the capitals differentone with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the Ionian style another introducing Mrs Flacks initialsevery one different For he had read his Ruskin He built his villas according to his desire and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs Honeychurchs carriage He had failed in his duties to the countryside and the countryside was laughing at him as well He had spent money and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for Cissiesomeone really desirable The rent is absurdly low he told them and perhaps I am an easy landlord But it is such an awkward size It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful You ought to find a tenant at once he said maliciously It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk Exactly said Sir Harry excitedly That is exactly what I fear Mr Vyse It will attract the wrong type of people The train service has improveda fatal improvement to my mind And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles Rather a strenuous clerk it would be said Lucy Cecil who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour and roused herself to stop him Sir Harry she exclaimed I have an idea How would you like spinsters My dear Lucy it would be splendid Do you know any such Yes I met them abroad Gentlewomen he asked tentatively Yes indeed and at the present moment homeless I heard from them last weekMiss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan Im really not joking They are quite the right people Mr Beebe knows them too May I tell them to write to you Indeed you may he cried Here we are with the difficulty solved already How delightful it is Extra facilitiesplease tell them they shall have extra facilities for I shall have no agents fees Oh the agents The appalling people they have sent me One woman when I wrotea tactful letter you knowasking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance As if one cares about that And several references I took up were most unsatisfactorypeople swindlers or not respectable And oh the deceit I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week The deceit of the most promising people My dear Lucy the deceit She nodded My advice put in Mrs Honeychurch is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all I know the type Preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy Its a sad thing but Id far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down I think I follow you said Sir Harry but it is as you say a very sad thing The Misses Alan arent that cried Lucy Yes they are said Cecil I havent met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood Dont listen to him Sir Harryhes tiresome Its I who am tiresome he replied I oughtnt to come with my troubles to young people But really I am so worried and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help Then may I write to my Misses Alan Please But his eye wavered when Mrs Honeychurch exclaimed Beware They are certain to have canaries Sir Harry beware of canaries they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come Beware of women altogether Only let to a man Really he murmured gallantly though he saw the wisdom of her remark Men dont gossip over teacups If they get drunk theres an end of themthey lie down comfortably and sleep it off If theyre vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves It doesnt spread so Give me a manof course provided hes clean Sir Harry blushed Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction He suggested that Mrs Honeychurch if she had time should descend from the carriage and inspect Cissie for herself She was delighted Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house Domestic arrangements always attracted her especially when they were on a small scale Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother Mrs Honeychurch he said what if we two walk home and leave you Certainly was her cordial reply Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them He beamed at them knowingly said Aha young people young people and then hastened to unlock the house Hopeless vulgarian exclaimed Cecil almost before they were out of earshot Oh Cecil I cant help it It would be wrong not to loathe that man He isnt clever but really he is nice No Lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life In London he would keep his place He would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties But down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and every oneeven your motheris taken in All that you say is quite true said Lucy though she felt discouraged I wonder whetherwhether it matters so very much It matters supremely Sir Harry is the essence of that gardenparty Oh goodness how cross I feel How I do hope hell get some vulgar tenant in that villasome woman so really vulgar that hell notice it Gentlefolks Ugh with his bald head and retreating chin But lets forget him This Lucy was glad enough to do If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr Beebe what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape For instance Freddy Freddy was neither clever nor subtle nor beautiful and what prevented Cecil from saying any minute It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy And what would she reply Further than Freddy she did not go but he gave her anxiety enough She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time and that they had always got on pleasantly except perhaps during the last few days which was an accident perhaps Which way shall we go she asked him Naturesimplest of topics she thoughtwas around them Summer Street lay deep in the woods and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad Are there two ways Perhaps the road is more sensible as were got up smart Id rather go through the wood said Cecil With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon Why is it Lucy that you always say the road Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged Havent I The wood then said Lucy startled at his queerness but pretty sure that he would explain later it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning She led the way into the whispering pines and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards I had got an ideaI dare say wronglythat you feel more at home with me in a room A room she echoed hopelessly bewildered Yes Or at the most in a garden or on a road Never in the real country like this Oh Cecil whatever do you mean I have never felt anything of the sort You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person I dont know that you arent I connect you with a viewa certain type of view Why shouldnt you connect me with a room She reflected a moment and then said laughing Do you know that youre right I do I must be a poetess after all When I think of you its always as in a room How funny To her surprise he seemed annoyed A drawingroom pray With no view Yes with no view I fancy Why not Id rather he said reproachfully that you connected me with the open air She said again Oh Cecil whatever do you mean As no explanation was forthcoming she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl and led him further into the wood pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone she had played at losing Freddy in it when Freddy was a purplefaced baby and though she had been to Italy it had lost none of its charm Presently they came to a little clearing among the pinesanother tiny green alp solitary this time and holding in its bosom a shallow pool She exclaimed The Sacred Lake Why do you call it that I cant remember why I suppose it comes out of some book Its only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it Well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and cant get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful Then Freddy used to bathe there He is very fond of it And you He meant Are you fond of it But she answered dreamily I bathed here too till I was found out Then there was a row At another time he might have been shocked for he had depths of prudishness within him But now with his momentary cult of the fresh air he was delighted at her admirable simplicity He looked at her as she stood by the pools edge She was got up smart as she phrased it and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own but blooms abruptly out of a world of green Who found you out Charlotte she murmured She was stopping with us CharlotteCharlotte Poor girl She smiled gravely A certain scheme from which hitherto he had shrunk now appeared practical Lucy Yes I suppose we ought to be going was her reply Lucy I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him What Cecil Hitherto nevernot even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me He became selfconscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed His courage had gone Yes Up to now I have never kissed you She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately Nomore you have she stammered Then I ask youmay I now Of course you may Cecil You might before I cant run at you you know At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities Her reply was inadequate She gave such a businesslike lift to her veil As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil As he touched her his gold pincenez became dislodged and was flattened between them Such was the embrace He considered with truth that it had been a failure Passion should believe itself irresistible It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature Above all it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way Why could he not do as any labourer or navvynay as any young man behind the counter would have done He recast the scene Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water he rushed up and took her in his arms she rebuked him permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness For he believed that women revere men for their manliness They left the pool in silence after this one salutation He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts At last she spoke and with fitting gravity Emerson was the name not Harris What name The old mans What old man That old man I told you about The one Mr Eager was so unkind to He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to Her father a prosperous local solicitor had built Windy Corner as a speculation at the time the district was opening up and falling in love with his own creation had ended by living there himself Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others again among the pinetrees behind and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner and were filled by people who came not from the district but from London and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy He was inclined to be frightened but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility I cannot think what people are doing she would say but it is extremely fortunate for the children She called everywhere her calls were returned with enthusiasm and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu they liked her and it did not seem to matter When Mr Honeychurch died he had the satisfactionwhich few honest solicitors despiseof leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable The best obtainable Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioningtheir kindly affluence their inexplosive religion their dislike of paperbags orangepeel and broken bottles A Radical out and out she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia Life so far as she troubled to conceive it was a circle of rich pleasant people with identical interests and identical foes In this circle one thought married and died Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter just as the London fog tries to enter the pinewoods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills But in Italy where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality as in the sun this conception of life vanished Her senses expanded she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like that social barriers were irremovable doubtless but not particularly high You jump over them just as you jump into a peasants oliveyard in the Apennines and he is glad to see you She returned with new eyes So did Cecil but Italy had quickened Cecil not to tolerance but to irritation He saw that the local society was narrow but instead of saying Does that very much matter he rebelled and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time and that though her eyes saw its defects her heart refused to despise it entirely Nor did he realize a more important pointthat if she was too great for this society she was too great for all society and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her A rebel she was but not of the kind he understooda rebel who desired not a wider dwellingroom but equality beside the man she loved For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessionsher own soul Playing bumblepuppy with Minnie Beebe niece to the rector and aged thirteenan ancient and most honourable game which consists in striking tennisballs high into the air so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce some hit Mrs Honeychurch others are lost The sentence is confused but the better illustrates Lucys state of mind for she was trying to talk to Mr Beebe at the same time Oh it has been such a nuisancefirst he then theyno one knowing what they wanted and everyone so tiresome But they really are coming now said Mr Beebe I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days agoshe was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably They are coming I heard from them this morning I shall hate those Miss Alans Mrs Honeychurch cried Just because theyre old and silly ones expected to say How sweet I hate their ifing and buting and anding And poor Lucyserve her rightworn to a shadow Mr Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tenniscourt Cecil was absentone did not play bumblepuppy when he was there Well if they are comingNo Minnie not Saturn Saturn was a tennisball whose skin was partially unsewn When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring If they are coming Sir Harry will let them move in before the twentyninth and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings because it made them nervous and put in the fair wear and tear oneThat doesnt count I told you not Saturn Saturns all right for bumblepuppy cried Freddy joining them Minnie dont you listen to her Saturn doesnt bounce Saturn bounces enough No he doesnt Well he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil Hush dear said Mrs Honeychurch But look at Lucycomplaining of Saturn and all the times got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand ready to plug it in Thats right Minnie go for herget her over the shins with the racquetget her over the shins Lucy fell the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand Mr Beebe picked it up and said The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona please But his correction passed unheeded Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a wellmannered child into a howling wilderness Up in the house Cecil heard them and though he was full of entertaining news he did not come down to impart it in case he got hurt He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man But he hated the physical violence of the young How right it was Sure enough it ended in a cry I wish the Miss Alans could see this observed Mr Beebe just as Lucy who was nursing the injured Minnie was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother Who are the Miss Alans Freddy panted They have taken Cissie Villa That wasnt the name Here his foot slipped and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass An interval elapses Wasnt what name asked Lucy with her brothers head in her lap Alan wasnt the name of the people Sir Harrys let to Nonsense Freddy You know nothing about it Nonsense yourself Ive this minute seen him He said to me Ahem HoneychurchFreddy was an indifferent mimicahem ahem I have at last procured really deesirerebel tenants I said ooray old boy and slapped him on the back Exactly The Miss Alans Rather not More like Anderson Oh good gracious there isnt going to be another muddle Mrs Honeychurch exclaimed Do you notice Lucy Im always right I said dont interfere with Cissie Villa Im always right Im quite uneasy at being always right so often Its only another muddle of Freddys Freddy doesnt even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead Yes I do Ive got it Emerson What name Emerson Ill bet you anything you like What a weathercock Sir Harry is said Lucy quietly I wish I had never bothered over it at all Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky Mr Beebe whose opinion of her rose daily whispered to his niece that that was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities Emerson Freddy Do you know what Emersons they are I dont know whether theyre any Emersons retorted Freddy who was democratic Like his sister and like most young people he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure I trust they are the right sort of person All right Lucyshe was sitting up againI see you looking down your nose and thinking your mothers a snob But there is a right sort and a wrong sort and its affectation to pretend there isnt Emersons a common enough name Lucy remarked She was gazing sideways Seated on a promontory herself she could see the pineclad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald The further one descended the garden the more glorious was this lateral view I was merely going to remark Freddy that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher a most trying man Pray does that satisfy you Oh yes he grumbled And you will be satisfied too for theyre friends of Cecil soelaborate ironyyou and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety Cecil exclaimed Lucy Dont be rude dear said his mother placidly Lucy dont screech Its a new bad habit youre getting into But has Cecil Friends of Cecils he repeated and so really deesirerebel Ahem Honeychurch I have just telegraphed to them She got up from the grass It was hard on Lucy Mr Beebe sympathized with her very much While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway she had borne it like a good girl She might well screech when she heard that it came partly from her lover Mr Vyse was a teasesomething worse than a tease he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people The clergyman knowing this looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness When she exclaimed But Cecils Emersonsthey cant possibly be the same onesthere is that he did not consider that the exclamation was strange but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure He diverted it as follows The Emersons who were at Florence do you mean No I dont suppose it will prove to be them It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr Vyses Oh Mrs Honeychurch the oddest people The queerest people For our part we liked them didnt we He appealed to Lucy There was a great scene over some violets They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa Poor little ladies So shocked and so pleased It used to be one of Miss Catharines great stories My dear sister loves flowers it began They found the whole room a mass of bluevases and jugsand the story ends with So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful It is all very difficult Yes I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets Fiascos done you this time remarked Freddy not seeing that his sisters face was very red She could not recover herself Mr Beebe saw it and continued to divert the conversation These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a sonthe son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool I fancy but very immaturepessimism et cetera Our special joy was the fathersuch a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife In his normal state Mr Beebe would never have repeated such gossip but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble He repeated any rubbish that came into his head Murdered his wife said Mrs Honeychurch Lucy dont desert usgo on playing bumblepuppy Really the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place Thats the second murderer Ive heard of as being there Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop Bytheby we really must ask Charlotte here some time Mr Beebe could recall no second murderer He suggested that his hostess was mistaken At the hint of opposition she warmed She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told The name escaped her What was the name Oh what was the name She clasped her knees for the name Something in Thackeray She struck her matronly forehead Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in Oh dont go he cried and tried to catch her by the ankles I must go she said gravely Dont be silly You always overdo it when you play As she left them her mothers shout of Harris shivered the tranquil air and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right Such a senseless lie too yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons friends of Cecils with a pair of nondescript tourists Hitherto truth had come to her naturally She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant and beabsolutely truthful Well at all events she must not tell lies She hurried up the garden still flushed with shame A word from Cecil would soothe her she was sure Cecil Hullo he called and leant out of the smokingroom window He seemed in high spirits I was hoping youd come I heard you all beargardening but theres better fun up here I even I have won a great victory for the Comic Muse George Merediths rightthe cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same and I even I have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa Dont be angry Dont be angry Youll forgive me when you hear it all He looked very attractive when his face was bright and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once I have heard she said Freddy has told us Naughty Cecil I suppose I must forgive you Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome and Id rather have nice friends of yours But you oughtnt to tease one so Friends of mine he laughed But Lucy the whole joke is to come Come here But she remained standing where she was Do you know where I met these desirable tenants In the National Gallery when I was up to see my mother last week What an odd place to meet people she said nervously I dont quite understand In the Umbrian Room Absolute strangers They were admiring Luca Signorelliof course quite stupidly However we got talking and they refreshed me not a little They had been to Italy But Cecil proceeded hilariously In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottagethe father to live there the son to run down for weekends I thought What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry and I took their address and a London reference found they werent actual blackguardsit was great sportand wrote to him making out Cecil No its not fair Ive probably met them before He bore her down Perfectly fair Anything is fair that punishes a snob That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good Sir Harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen I meant to read him a lesson some time No Lucy the classes ought to mix and before long youll agree with me There ought to be intermarriageall sorts of things I believe in democracy No you dont she snapped You dont know what the word means He stared at her and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque No you dont Her face was inartisticthat of a peevish virago It isnt fair Cecil I blame youI blame you very much indeed You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans and make me look ridiculous You call it scoring off Sir Harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense I consider it most disloyal of you She left him Temper he thought raising his eyebrows No it was worse than tempersnobbishness As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans she had not minded He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally He would tolerate the father and draw out the son who was silent In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth he would bring them to Windy Corner Chapter XI In Mrs Vyses WellAppointed Flat The Comic Muse though able to look after her own interests did not disdain the assistance of Mr Vyse His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement met Mr Emerson who was duly disillusioned The Miss Alans were duly offended and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy whom they held responsible for the failure Mr Beebe planned pleasant moments for the newcomers and told Mrs Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived Indeed so ample was the Muses equipment that she permitted Mr Harris never a very robust criminal to droop his head to be forgotten and to die Lucyto descend from bright heaven to earth whereon there are shadows because there are hillsLucy was at first plunged into despair but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least Now that she was engaged the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood But as I say this took a little thinking andso illogical are girlsthe event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done She was glad that a visit to Mrs Vyse now fell due the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat CecilCecil darling she whispered the evening she arrived and crept into his arms Cecil too became demonstrative He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy At last she longed for attention as a woman should and looked up to him because he was a man So you do love me little thing he murmured Oh Cecil I do I do I dont know what I should do without you Several days passed Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins and they had not corresponded since they parted in August The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call the flight to Rome and in Rome it had increased amazingly For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical Charlotte unselfish in the Forum would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucys and once in the Baths of Caracalla they had doubted whether they could continue their tour Lucy had said she would join the VysesMrs Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly Finally nothing happened but the coolness remained and for Lucy was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows It had been forwarded from Windy Corner TUNBRIDGE WELLS September DEAREST LUCIA I have news of you at last Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts but was not sure whether a call would be welcome Puncturing her tire near Summer Street and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard she saw to her astonishment a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out He said his father had just taken the house He said he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea Dear Lucy I am much worried and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother Freddy and Mr Vyse who will forbid him to enter the house etc That was a great misfortune and I dare say you have told them already Mr Vyse is so sensitive I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome I am very sorry about it all and should not feel easy unless I warned you Believe me Your anxious and loving cousin CHARLOTTE Lucy was much annoyed and replied as follows BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS SW DEAR CHARLOTTE Many thanks for your warning When Mr Emerson forgot himself on the mountain you made me promise not to tell mother because you said she would blame you for not being always with me I have kept that promise and cannot possibly tell her now I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence and that they are respectable peoplewhich I do thinkand the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself She should have tried at the Rectory I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage You must see that it would be too absurd If the Emersons heard I had complained of them they would think themselves of importance which is exactly what they are not I like the old father and look forward to seeing him again As for the son I am sorry for him when we meet rather than for myself They are known to Cecil who is very well and spoke of you the other day We expect to be married in January Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me for I am not at Windy Corner at all but here Please do not put Private outside your envelope again No one opens my letters Yours affectionately L M HONEYCHURCH Secrecy has this disadvantage we lose the sense of proportion we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecils life if he discovered it or with a little thing which he would laugh at Miss Bartlett suggested the former Perhaps she was right It had become a great thing now Left to herself Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously and it would have remained a little thing Emerson not Harris it was only that a few weeks ago She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on It did her no harm Cecil thought to learn the framework of society while society itself was absent on the golflinks or the moors The weather was cool and it did her no harm In spite of the season Mrs Vyse managed to scrape together a dinnerparty consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people The food was poor but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl One was tired of everything it seemed One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past The grandchildren asked her to play the piano She played Schumann Now some Beethoven called Cecil when the querulous beauty of the music had died She shook her head and played Schumann again The melody rose unprofitably magical It broke it was resumed broken not marching once from the cradle to the grave The sadness of the incompletethe sadness that is often Life but should never be Artthrobbed in its disjected phrases and made the nerves of the audience throb Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini and Too much Schumann was not the remark that Mr Beebe had passed to himself when she returned When the guests were gone and Lucy had gone to bed Mrs Vyse paced up and down the drawingroom discussing her little party with her son Mrs Vyse was a nice woman but her personality like many anothers had been swamped by London for it needs a strong head to live among many people The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her and she had seen too many seasons too many cities too many men for her abilities and even with Cecil she was mechanical and behaved as if he was not one son but so to speak a filial crowd Make Lucy one of us she said looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence and straining her lips apart until she spoke again Lucy is becoming wonderfulwonderful Her music always was wonderful Yes but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint most excellent Honeychurches but you know what I mean She is not always quoting servants or asking one how the pudding is made Italy has done it Perhaps she murmured thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her It is just possible Cecil mind you marry her next January She is one of us already But her music he exclaimed The style of her How she kept to Schumann when like an idiot I wanted Beethoven Schumann was right for this evening Schumann was the thing Do you know mother I shall have our children educated just like Lucy Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness send them to Italy for subtlety and thennot till thenlet them come to London I dont believe in these London educations He broke off remembering that he had had one himself and concluded At all events not for women Make her one of us repeated Mrs Vyse and processed to bed As she was dozing off a crythe cry of nightmarerang from Lucys room Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs Vyse thought it kind to go herself She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek I am so sorry Mrs Vyseit is these dreams Bad dreams Just dreams The elder lady smiled and kissed her saying very distinctly You should have heard us talking about you dear He admires you more than ever Dream of that Lucy returned the kiss still covering one cheek with her hand Mrs Vyse recessed to bed Cecil whom the cry had not awoke snored Darkness enveloped the flat Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon gay and brilliant after abundant rains and the spirit of youth dwelt in it though the season was now autumn All that was gracious triumphed As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines Mr Beebe at leisure for lifes amenities leant over his Rectory gate Freddy leant by him smoking a pendant pipe Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little Mm They might amuse you Freddy whom his fellowcreatures never amused suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy and so on since they had only just moved in I suggested we should hinder them said Mr Beebe They are worth it Unlatching the gate he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa Hullo he cried shouting in at the open door through which much squalor was visible A grave voice replied Hullo Ive brought someone to see you Ill be down in a minute The passage was blocked by a wardrobe which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs Mr Beebe edged round it with difficulty The sittingroom itself was blocked with books Are these people great readers Freddy whispered Are they that sort I fancy they know how to reada rare accomplishment What have they got Byron Exactly A Shropshire Lad Never heard of it The Way of All Flesh Never heard of it Gibbon Hullo dear George reads German UmumSchopenhauer Nietzsche and so we go on Well I suppose your generation knows its own business Honeychurch Mr Beebe look at that said Freddy in awestruck tones On the cornice of the wardrobe the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes I know Isnt it jolly I like that Im certain thats the old mans doing How very odd of him Surely you agree But Freddy was his mothers son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture Pictures the clergyman continued scrambling about the room Giottothey got that at Florence Ill be bound The same as Lucys got Oh bytheby did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London She came back yesterday I suppose she had a good time Yes very said Freddy taking up a book She and Cecil are thicker than ever Thats good hearing I wish I wasnt such a fool Mr Beebe Mr Beebe ignored the remark Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am but itll be very different now mother thinks She will read all kinds of books So will you Only medical books Not books that you can talk about afterwards Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian and he says her playing is wonderful There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed Cecil says What on earth are those people doing upstairs Emersonwe think well come another time George ran downstairs and pushed them into the room without speaking Let me introduce Mr Honeychurch a neighbour Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth Perhaps he was shy perhaps he was friendly or perhaps he thought that Georges face wanted washing At all events he greeted him with How dye do Come and have a bathe Oh all right said George impassive Mr Beebe was highly entertained How dye do how dye do Come and have a bathe he chuckled Thats the best conversational opening Ive ever heard But Im afraid it will only act between men Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with How do you do Come and have a bathe And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal I tell you that they shall be said Mr Emerson who had been slowly descending the stairs Good afternoon Mr Beebe I tell you they shall be comrades and George thinks the same We are to raise ladies to our level the clergyman inquired The Garden of Eden pursued Mr Emerson still descending which you place in the past is really yet to come We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies Mr Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere In thisnot in other thingswe men are ahead We despise the body less than women do But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden I say what about this bathe murmured Freddy appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him I believed in a return to Nature once But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her Today I believe that we must discover Nature After many conquests we shall attain simplicity It is our heritage Let me introduce Mr Honeychurch whose sister you will remember at Florence How do you do Very glad to see you and that you are taking George for a bathe Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry Marriage is a duty I am sure that she will be happy for we know Mr Vyse too He has been most kind He met us by chance in the National Gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway I have met so few Liberal landowners and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude Ah this wind You do well to bathe Yours is a glorious country Honeychurch Not a bit mumbled Freddy I mustthat is to say I have tohave the pleasure of calling on you later on my mother says I hope Call my lad Who taught us that drawingroom twaddle Call on your grandmother Listen to the wind among the pines Yours is a glorious country Mr Beebe came to the rescue Mr Emerson he will call I shall call you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed I trust that you have realized about the ten days interval It does not count that I helped you with the staireyes yesterday It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon Yes go and bathe George Why do you dawdle talking Bring them back to tea Bring back some milk cakes honey The change will do you good George has been working very hard at his office I cant believe hes well George bowed his head dusty and sombre exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture Do you really want this bathe Freddy asked him It is only a pond dont you know I dare say you are used to something better YesI have said Yes already Mr Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend and led the way out of the house and into the pinewoods How glorious it was For a little time the voice of old Mr Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy It ceased and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees Mr Beebe who could be silent but who could not bear silence was compelled to chatter since the expedition looked like a failure and neither of his companions would utter a word He spoke of Florence George attended gravely assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the treetops above their heads And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr Vyse Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here I did not Miss Lavish told me When I was a young man I always meant to write a History of Coincidence No enthusiasm Though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose For example it isnt purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect To his relief George began to talk It is I have reflected It is Fate Everything is Fate We are flung together by Fate drawn apart by Fateflung together drawn apart The twelve winds blow uswe settle nothing You have not reflected at all rapped the clergyman Let me give you a useful tip Emerson attribute nothing to Fate Dont say I didnt do this for you did it ten to one Now Ill crossquestion you Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself Italy And where did you meet Mr Vyse who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch National Gallery Looking at Italian art There you are and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate You naturally seek out things Italian and so do we and our friends This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it It is Fate that I am here persisted George But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy Mr Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject But he was infinitely tolerant of the young and had no desire to snub George And so for this and for other reasons my History of Coincidence is still to write Silence Wishing to round off the episode he added We are all so glad that you have come Silence Here we are called Freddy Oh good exclaimed Mr Beebe mopping his brow In theres the pond I wish it was bigger he added apologetically They climbed down a slippery bank of pineneedles There lay the pond set in its little alp of greenonly a pond but large enough to contain the human body and pure enough to reflect the sky On account of the rains the waters had flooded the surrounding grass which showed like a beautiful emerald path tempting these feet towards the central pool Its distinctly successful as ponds go said Mr Beebe No apologies are necessary for the pond George sat down where the ground was dry and drearily unlaced his boots Arent those masses of willowherb splendid I love willowherb in seed Whats the name of this aromatic plant No one knew or seemed to care These abrupt changes of vegetationthis little spongeous tract of water plants and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittleheather bracken hurts pines Very charming very charming Mr Beebe arent you bathing called Freddy as he stripped himself Mr Beebe thought he was not Waters wonderful cried Freddy prancing in Waters water murmured George Wetting his hair firsta sure sign of apathyhe followed Freddy into the divine as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds It was necessary to use his muscles It was necessary to keep clean Mr Beebe watched them and watched the seeds of the willowherb dance chorically above their heads Apooshoo apooshoo apooshoo went Freddy swimming for two strokes in either direction and then becoming involved in reeds or mud Is it worth it asked the other Michelangelesque on the flooded margin The bank broke away and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly HeepoofIve swallowed a pollywog Mr Beebe waters wonderful waters simply ripping Waters not so bad said George reappearing from his plunge and sputtering at the sun Waters wonderful Mr Beebe do Apooshoo kouf Mr Beebe who was hot and who always acquiesced where possible looked around him He could detect no parishioners except the pinetrees rising up steeply on all sides and gesturing to each other against the blue How glorious it was The world of motorcars and rural Deans receded inimitably Water sky evergreens a windthese things not even the seasons can touch and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man I may as well wash too and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward and he too asserted the wonder of the water It was ordinary water nor was there very much of it and as Freddy said it reminded one of swimming in a salad The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high after the fashion of the nymphs in Gtterdmmerung But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spiritfor some reason or other a change came over them and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate They began to play Mr Beebe and Freddy splashed each other A little deferentially they splashed George He was quiet they feared they had offended him Then all the forces of youth burst out He smiled flung himself at them splashed them ducked them kicked them muddied them and drove them out of the pool Race you round it then cried Freddy and they raced in the sunshine and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins and had to bathe a second time Then Mr Beebe consented to runa memorable sight They ran to get dry they bathed to get cool they played at being Indians in the willowherbs and in the bracken they bathed to get clean And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward proclaiming No We are what matters Without us shall no enterprise begin To us shall all flesh turn in the end A try A try yelled Freddy snatching up Georges bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goalpost Socker rules George retorted scattering Freddys bundle with a kick Goal Goal Pass Take care my watch cried Mr Beebe Clothes flew in all directions Take care my hat No thats enough Freddy Dress now No I say But the two young men were delirious Away they twinkled into the trees Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm George with a wideawake hat on his dripping hair Thatll do shouted Mr Beebe remembering that after all he was in his own parish Then his voice changed as if every pinetree was a Rural Dean Hi Steady on I see people coming you fellows Yells and widening circles over the dappled earth Hi hi Ladies Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined Still they did not hear Mr Beebes last warning or they would have avoided Mrs Honeychurch Cecil and Lucy who were walking down to call on old Mrs Butterworth Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet and dashed into some bracken George whooped in their faces turned and scudded away down the path to the pond still clad in Mr Beebes hat Gracious alive cried Mrs Honeychurch Whoever were those unfortunate people Oh dears look away And poor Mr Beebe too Whatever has happened Come this way immediately commanded Cecil who always felt that he must lead women though he knew not whither and protect them though he knew not against what He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed Oh poor Mr Beebe Was that his waistcoat we left in the path Cecil Mr Beebes waistcoat No business of ours said Cecil glancing at Lucy who was all parasol and evidently minded I fancy Mr Beebe jumped back into the pond This way please Mrs Honeychurch this way They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions Well I cant help it said a voice close ahead and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds I cant be trodden on can I Good gracious me dear so its you What miserable management Why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on Look here mother a fellow must wash and a fellows got to dry and if another fellow Dear no doubt youre right as usual but you are in no position to argue Come Lucy They turned Oh lookdont look Oh poor Mr Beebe How unfortunate again For Mr Beebe was just crawling out of the pond on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float while George the worldweary George shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish And me Ive swallowed one answered he of the bracken Ive swallowed a pollywog It wriggleth in my tummy I shall dieEmerson you beast youve got on my bags Hush dears said Mrs Honeychurch who found it impossible to remain shocked And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first All these colds come of not drying thoroughly Mother do come away said Lucy Oh for goodness sake do come Hullo cried George so that again the ladies stopped He regarded himself as dressed Barefoot barechested radiant and personable against the shadowy woods he called Hullo Miss Honeychurch Hullo Bow Lucy better bow Whoever is it I shall bow Miss Honeychurch bowed That evening and all that night the water ran away On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will a passing benediction whose influence did not pass a holiness a spell a momentary chalice for youth Chapter XIII How Miss Bartletts Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow this interview But she had always rehearsed them indoors and with certain accessories which surely we have a right to assume Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth She had imagined a young Mr Emerson who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent She was prepared for all of these But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star Indoors herself partaking of tea with old Mrs Butterworth she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy that it is impossible to rehearse life A fault in the scenery a face in the audience an irruption of the audience on to the stage and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing or mean too much I will bow she had thought I will not shake hands with him That will be just the proper thing She had bowedbut to whom To gods to heroes to the nonsense of schoolgirls She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world So ran her thoughts while her faculties were busy with Cecil It was another of those dreadful engagement calls Mrs Butterworth had wanted to see him and he did not want to be seen He did not want to hear about hydrangeas why they change their colour at the seaside He did not want to join the C O S When cross he was always elaborate and made long clever answers where Yes or No would have done Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace No one is perfect and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock Miss Bartlett indeed though not in word had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory Lucy though she disliked the teacher regarded the teaching as profound and applied it to her lover Lucy said her mother when they got home is anything the matter with Cecil The question was ominous up till now Mrs Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint No I dont think so mother Cecils all right Perhaps hes tired Lucy compromised perhaps Cecil was a little tired Because otherwiseshe pulled out her bonnetpins with gathering displeasurebecause otherwise I cannot account for him I do think Mrs Butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that Cecil has told you to think so You were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever Noit is just the same thing everywhere Let me just put your bonnet away may I Surely he could answer her civilly for one halfhour Cecil has a very high standard for people faltered Lucy seeing trouble ahead Its part of his idealsit is really that that makes him sometimes seem Oh rubbish If high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better said Mrs Honeychurch handing her the bonnet Now mother Ive seen you cross with Mrs Butterworth yourself Not in that way At times I could wring her neck But not in that way No It is the same with Cecil all over BythebyI never told you I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile and Mrs Honeychurch resented it Since Cecil came back from London nothing appears to please him Whenever I speak he wincesI see him Lucy it is useless to contradict me No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but I cannot help the drawingroom furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will Cecil kindly remember II see what you mean and certainly Cecil oughtnt to But he does not mean to be uncivilhe once explainedit is the things that upset himhe is easily upset by ugly thingshe is not uncivil to people Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings You cant expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do Then why didnt he leave the room Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyones pleasure We mustnt be unjust to people faltered Lucy Something had enfeebled her and the case for Cecil which she had mastered so perfectly in London would not come forth in an effective form The two civilizations had clashedCecil hinted that they mightand she was dazzled and bewildered as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords garments of diverse cut and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pinetrees where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song She remained in much embarrassment while Mrs Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner and every now and then she said a word and made things no better There was no concealing the fact Cecil had meant to be supercilious and he had succeeded And Lucyshe knew not whywished that the trouble could have come at any other time Go and dress dear youll be late All right mother Dont say All right and stop Go She obeyed but loitered disconsolately at the landing window It faced north so there was little view and no view of the sky Now as in the winter the pinetrees hung close to her eyes One connected the landing window with depression No definite problem menaced her but she sighed to herself Oh dear what shall I do what shall I do It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartletts letter She must be more careful her mother was rather inquisitive and might have asked what it was about Oh dear what should she doand then Freddy came bounding upstairs and joined the ranks of the illbehaved I say those are topping people My dear baby how tiresome youve been You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake its much too public It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else Do be more careful You forget the place is growing half suburban I say is anything on tomorrow week Not that I know of Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis Oh I wouldnt do that Freddy I wouldnt do that with all this muddle Whats wrong with the court They wont mind a bump or two and Ive ordered new balls I meant its better not I really mean it He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage She pretended not to mind but she could have screamed with temper Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hotwater cans Then Mrs Honeychurch opened her door and said Lucy what a noise youre making I have something to say to you Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte and Freddy ran away Yes I really cant stop I must dress too Hows Charlotte All right Lucy The unfortunate girl returned Youve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of ones sentences Did Charlotte mention her boiler Her what Dont you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible todoings I cant remember all Charlottes worries said Lucy bitterly I shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with Cecil Mrs Honeychurch might have flamed out She did not She said Come here old ladythank you for putting away my bonnetkiss me And though nothing is perfect Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect So the grittiness went out of life It generally did at Windy Corner At the last minute when the social machine was clogged hopelessly one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil Cecil despised their methodsperhaps rightly At all events they were not his own Dinner was at halfpast seven Freddy gabbled the grace and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to Fortunately the men were hungry Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding Then Freddy said Lucy whats Emerson like I saw him in Florence said Lucy hoping that this would pass for a reply Is he the clever sort or is he a decent chap Ask Cecil it is Cecil who brought him here He is the clever sort like myself said Cecil Freddy looked at him doubtfully How well did you know them at the Bertolini asked Mrs Honeychurch Oh very slightly I mean Charlotte knew them even less than I did Oh that reminds meyou never told me what Charlotte said in her letter One thing and another said Lucy wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie Among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street wondered if shed come up and see us and mercifully didnt Lucy I do call the way you talk unkind She was a novelist said Lucy craftily The remark was a happy one for nothing roused Mrs Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who instead of minding their houses and their children seek notoriety by print Her attitude was If books must be written let them be written by men and she developed it at great length while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at This year next year now never with his plumstones and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mothers wrath But soon the conflagration died down and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness There were too many ghosts about The original ghostthat touch of lips on her cheekhad surely been laid long ago it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once But it had begotten a spectral familyMr Harris Miss Bartletts letter Mr Beebes memories of violetsand one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecils very eyes It was Miss Bartlett who returned now and with appalling vividness I have been thinking Lucy of that letter of Charlottes How is she I tore the thing up Didnt she say how she was How does she sound Cheerful Oh yes I suppose sononot very cheerful I suppose Then depend upon it it is the boiler I know myself how water preys upon ones mind I would rather anything elseeven a misfortune with the meat Cecil laid his hand over his eyes So would I asserted Freddy backing his mother upbacking up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance And I have been thinking she added rather nervously surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long It was more than her nerves could stand And she could not protest violently after her mothers goodness to her upstairs Mother no she pleaded Its impossible We cant have Charlotte on the top of the other things were squeezed to death as it is Freddys got a friend coming Tuesday theres Cecil and youve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare It simply cant be done Nonsense It can If Minnie sleeps in the bath Not otherwise Minnie can sleep with you I wont have her Then if youre so selfish Mr Floyd must share a room with Freddy Miss Bartlett Miss Bartlett Miss Bartlett moaned Cecil again laying his hand over his eyes Its impossible repeated Lucy I dont want to make difficulties but it really isnt fair on the maids to fill up the house so Alas The truth is dear you dont like Charlotte No I dont And no more does Cecil She gets on our nerves You havent seen her lately and dont realize how tiresome she can be though so good So please mother dont worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come Hear hear said Cecil Mrs Honeychurch with more gravity than usual and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself replied This isnt very kind of you two You have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers You are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old Cecil crumbled his bread I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike put in Freddy She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right I know dear She is kind to everyone and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return But Lucy hardened her heart It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett She had tried herself too often and too recently One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth She was reduced to saying I cant help it mother I dont like Charlotte I admit its horrid of me From your own account you told her as much Well she would leave Florence so stupidly She flurried The ghosts were returning they filled Italy they were even usurping the places she had known as a child The Sacred Lake would never be the same again and on Sunday week something would even happen to Windy Corner How would she fight against ghosts For a moment the visible world faded away and memories and emotions alone seemed real I suppose Miss Bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well said Cecil who was in rather a happier frame of mind thanks to the admirable cooking I didnt mean the egg was well boiled corrected Freddy because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact I dont care for eggs I only meant how jolly kind she seemed Cecil frowned again Oh these Honeychurches Eggs boilers hydrangeas maidsof such were their lives compact May me and Lucy get down from our chairs he asked with scarcely veiled insolence We dont want no dessert Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted And equally of course she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance and begged to be given an inferior spare roomsomething with no view anything Her love to Lucy And equally of course George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week Lucy faced the situation bravely though like most of us she only faced the situation that encompassed her She never gazed inwards If at times strange images rose from the depths she put them down to nerves When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street it had upset her nerves Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness and this might upset her nerves She was nervous at night When she talked to Georgethey met again almost immediately at the Rectoryhis voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him Of course the wish was due to nerves which love to play such perverse tricks upon us Once she had suffered from things that came out of nothing and meant she didnt know what Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude She loves young Emerson A reader in Lucys place would not find it obvious Life is easy to chronicle but bewildering to practice and we welcome nerves or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire She loved Cecil George made her nervous will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed But the external situationshe will face that bravely The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough Standing between Mr Beebe and Cecil she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy and George had replied She was anxious to show that she was not shy and was glad that he did not seem shy either A nice fellow said Mr Beebe afterwards He will work off his crudities in time I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully Lucy said He seems in better spirits He laughs more Yes replied the clergyman He is waking up That was all But as the week wore on more of her defences fell and she entertained an image that had physical beauty In spite of the clearest directions Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival She was due at the SouthEastern station at Dorking whither Mrs Honeychurch drove to meet her She arrived at the London and Brighton station and had to hire a cab up No one was at home except Freddy and his friend who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour Cecil and Lucy turned up at four oclock and these with little Minnie Beebe made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea I shall never forgive myself said Miss Bartlett who kept on rising from her seat and had to be begged by the united company to remain I have upset everything Bursting in on young people But I insist on paying for my cab up Grant that at any rate Our visitors never do such dreadful things said Lucy while her brother in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial exclaimed in irritable tones Just what Ive been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of Lucy for the last half hour I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor said Miss Bartlett and looked at her frayed glove All right if youd really rather Five shillings and I gave a bob to the driver Miss Bartlett looked in her purse Only sovereigns and pennies Could any one give her change Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four halfcrowns Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said But who am I to give the sovereign to Lets leave it all till mother comes back suggested Lucy No dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me We all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts Here Freddys friend Mr Floyd made the one remark of his that need be quoted he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartletts quid A solution seemed in sight and even Cecil who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view felt the eternal attraction of Chance and turned round But this did not do either PleasepleaseI know I am a sad spoilsport but it would make me wretched I should practically be robbing the one who lost Freddy owes me fifteen shillings interposed Cecil So it will work out right if you give the pound to me Fifteen shillings said Miss Bartlett dubiously How is that Mr Vyse Because dont you see Freddy paid your cab Give me the pound and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling Miss Bartlett who was poor at figures became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths For a moment Cecil was happy He was playing at nonsense among his peers Then he glanced at Lucy in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle But I dont see that exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction I dont see why Mr Vyse is to have the quid Because of the fifteen shillings and the five they said solemnly Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound you see But I dont see They tried to stifle her with cake No thank you Im done I dont see whyFreddy dont poke me Miss Honeychurch your brothers hurting me Ow What about Mr Floyds ten shillings Ow No I dont see and I never shall see why Miss Whatshername shouldnt pay that bob for the driver I had forgotten the driver said Miss Bartlett reddening Thank you dear for reminding me A shilling was it Can any one give me change for half a crown Ill get it said the young hostess rising with decision Cecil give me that sovereign No give me up that sovereign Ill get Euphemia to change it and well start the whole thing again from the beginning LucyLucywhat a nuisance I am protested Miss Bartlett and followed her across the lawn Lucy tripped ahead simulating hilarity When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly Have you told him about him yet No I havent replied Lucy and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant Let me seea sovereigns worth of silver She escaped into the kitchen Miss Bartletts sudden transitions were too uncanny It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul No I havent told Cecil or any one she remarked when she returned I promised you I shouldnt Here is your moneyall shillings except two halfcrowns Would you count it You can settle your debt nicely now Miss Bartlett was in the drawingroom gazing at the photograph of St John ascending which had been framed How dreadful she murmured how more than dreadful if Mr Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source Oh no Charlotte said the girl entering the battle George Emerson is all right and what other source is there Miss Bartlett considered For instance the driver I saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth Lucy shuddered a little We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we arent careful How could a Florentine cabdriver ever get hold of Cecil We must think of every possibility Oh its all right Or perhaps old Mr Emerson knows In fact he is certain to know I dont care if he does I was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it To contradict it No to laugh at it But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him for he desired her untouched Very well dear you know best Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young Ladies are certainly different Now Charlotte She struck at her playfully You kind anxious thing What would you have me do First you say Dont tell and then you say Tell Which is it to be Quick Miss Bartlett sighed I am no match for you in conversation dearest I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than I am You will never forgive me Shall we go out then They will smash all the china if we dont For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie who was being scalped with a teaspoon Dear one momentwe may not have this chance for a chat again Have you seen the young one yet Yes I have What happened We met at the Rectory What line is he taking up No line He talked about Italy like any other person It is really all right What advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly I do wish I could make you see it my way He really wont be any nuisance Charlotte Once a cad always a cad That is my poor opinion Lucy paused Cecil said one dayand I thought it so profoundthat there are two kinds of cadsthe conscious and the subconscious She paused again to be sure of doing justice to Cecils profundity Through the window she saw Cecil himself turning over the pages of a novel It was a new one from Smiths library Her mother must have returned from the station Once a cad always a cad droned Miss Bartlett What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head I fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised I dont think we ought to blame him very much It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly It really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesnt admire me or any of that nonsense one straw Freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on Sunday so you can judge for yourself He has improved he doesnt always look as if hes going to burst into tears He is a clerk in the General Managers office at one of the big railwaysnot a porter and runs down to his father for weekends Papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired There Now for the garden She took hold of her guest by the arm Suppose we dont talk about this silly Italian business any more We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner with no worriting Lucy thought this rather a good speech The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people She might have spoken further but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess Explanations took place and in the midst of them Lucy escaped the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartletts arrival was a glorious day like most of the days of that year In the Weald autumn approached breaking up the green monotony of summer touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist the beechtrees with russet the oaktrees with gold Up on the heights battalions of black pines witnessed the change themselves unchangeable Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky and in either arose the tinkle of church bells The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path From the house came incoherent sounds as of females preparing for worship The men say they wont goWell I dont blame themMinnie says need she goTell her no nonsenseAnne Mary Hook me behindDearest Lucia may I trespass upon you for a pin For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church The sun rose higher on its journey guided not by Phaethon but by Apollo competent unswerving divine Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows on Mr Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan on George Emerson cleaning his fathers boots and lastly to complete the catalogue of memorable things on the red book mentioned previously The ladies move Mr Beebe moves George moves and movement may engender shadow But this book lies motionless to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly as though acknowledging the caress Presently Lucy steps out of the drawingroom window Her new cerise dress has been a failure and makes her look tawdry and wan At her throat is a garnet brooch on her finger a ring set with rubiesan engagement ring Her eyes are bent to the Weald She frowns a littlenot in anger but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills Lucy Lucy Whats that book Whos been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil Its only the library book that Cecils been reading But pick it up and dont stand idling there like a flamingo Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly Under a Loggia She no longer read novels herself devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up It was dreadful how little she knew and even when she thought she knew a thing like the Italian painters she found she had forgotten it Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca and Cecil had said What you arent forgetting your Italy already And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground and above them scarcely conceivable elsewhere the dear sun Lucyhave you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself She hastened in to her mother who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster Its a special collectionI forget what for I do beg no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence Where is the child Minnie That books all warped Gracious how plain you look Put it under the Atlas to press Minnie Oh Mrs Honeychurch from the upper regions Minnie dont be late Here comes the horseit was always the horse never the carriage Wheres Charlotte Run up and hurry her Why is she so long She had nothing to do She never brings anything but blouses Poor CharlotteHow I do detest blouses Minnie Paganism is infectiousmore infectious than diphtheria or pietyand the Rectors niece was taken to church protesting As usual she didnt see why Why shouldnt she sit in the sun with the young men The young men who had now appeared mocked her with ungenerous words Mrs Honeychurch defended orthodoxy and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett dressed in the very height of the fashion came strolling down the stairs Dear Marian I am very sorry but I have no small changenothing but sovereigns and half crowns Could any one give me Yes easily Jump in Gracious me how smart you look What a lovely frock You put us all to shame If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now when should I wear them said Miss Bartlett reproachfully She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse The necessary roar ensued and then they drove off Goodbye Be good called out Cecil Lucy bit her lip for the tone was sneering On the subject of church and so on they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves and she did not want to overhaul herself she did not know it was done Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis he could not imagine it as a natural birthright that might grow heavenward like flowers All that he said on this subject pained her though he exuded tolerance from every pore somehow the Emersons were different She saw the Emersons after church There was a line of carriages down the road and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa To save time they walked over the green to it and found father and son smoking in the garden Introduce me said her mother Unless the young man considers that he knows me already He probably did but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally Old Mr Emerson claimed her with much warmth and said how glad he was that she was going to be married She said yes she was glad too and then as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr Beebe she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic and asked him how he liked his new house Very much he replied but there was a note of offence in his voice she had never known him offended before He added We find though that the Miss Alans were coming and that we have turned them out Women mind such a thing I am very much upset about it I believe that there was some misunderstanding said Mrs Honeychurch uneasily Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person said George who seemed disposed to carry the matter further He thought we should be artistic He is disappointed And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up What do you think He appealed to Lucy Oh stop now you have come said Lucy lightly She must avoid censuring Cecil For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned though his name was never mentioned So George says He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall Yet it does seem so unkind There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world said George watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages Yes exclaimed Mrs Honeychurch Thats exactly what I say Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans There is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light he continued in measured tones We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows Choose a place where you wont do harmyes choose a place where you wont do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine Oh Mr Emerson I see youre clever Eh I see youre going to be clever I hope you didnt go behaving like that to poor Freddy Georges eyes laughed and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well No I didnt he said He behaved that way to me It is his philosophy Only he starts life with it and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first What do you mean No never mind what you mean Dont explain He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon Do you play tennis Do you mind tennis on Sunday George mind tennis on Sunday George after his education distinguish between Sunday Very well George doesnt mind tennis on Sunday No more do I Thats settled Mr Emerson if you could come with your son we should be so pleased He thanked her but the walk sounded rather far he could only potter about in these days She turned to George And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans I know said George and put his arm round his fathers neck The kindness that Mr Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly like sunlight touching a vast landscapea touch of the morning sun She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection Miss Bartlett approached You know our cousin Miss Bartlett said Mrs Honeychurch pleasantly You met her with my daughter in Florence Yes indeed said the old man and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria Thus entrenched she emitted a formal bow It was the pension Bertolini again the diningtable with the decanters of water and wine It was the old old battle of the room with the view George did not respond to the bow Like any boy he blushed and was ashamed he knew that the chaperon remembered He said IIll come up to tennis if I can manage it and went into the house Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy but his awkwardness went straight to her heart men were not gods after all but as human and as clumsy as girls even men might suffer from unexplained desires and need help To one of her upbringing and of her destination the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar but she had surmised it at Florence when George threw her photographs into the River Arno George dont go cried his father who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them George has been in such good spirits today and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon Lucy caught her cousins eye Something in its mute appeal made her reckless Yes she said raising her voice I do hope he will Then she went to the carriage and murmured The old man hasnt been told I knew it was all right Mrs Honeychurch followed her and they drove away Satisfactory that Mr Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade yet Lucys spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven Satisfactory yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy All the way home the horses hoofs sang a tune to her He has not told he has not told Her brain expanded the melody He has not told his fatherto whom he tells all things It was not an exploit He did not laugh at me when I had gone She raised her hand to her cheek He does not love me No How terrible if he did But he has not told He will not tell She longed to shout the words It is all right Its a secret between us two for ever Cecil will never hear She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy that last dark evening at Florence when they had knelt packing in his room The secret big or little was guarded Only three English people knew of it in the world Thus she interpreted her joy She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance because she felt so safe As he helped her out of the carriage she said The Emersons have been so nice George Emerson has improved enormously How are my protgs asked Cecil who took no real interest in them and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes Protgs she exclaimed with some warmth For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal that of protector and protected He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girls soul yearned You shall see for yourself how your protgs are George Emerson is coming up this afternoon He is a most interesting man to talk to Only dont She nearly said Dont protect him But the bell was ringing for lunch and as often happened Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks Charm not argument was to be her forte Lunch was a cheerful meal Generally Lucy was depressed at meals Some one had to be soothedeither Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eyea Being who whispered to her soul It will not last this cheerfulness In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men But today she felt she had received a guarantee Her mother would always sit there her brother here The sun though it had moved a little since the morning would never be hidden behind the western hills After luncheon they asked her to play She had seen Glucks Armide that year and played from memory the music of the enchanted gardenthe music to which Renaud approaches beneath the light of an eternal dawn the music that never gains never wanes but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland Such music is not for the piano and her audience began to get restive and Cecil sharing the discontent called out Now play us the other gardenthe one in Parsifal She closed the instrument Not very dutiful said her mothers voice Fearing that she had offended Cecil she turned quickly round There George was He had crept in without interrupting her Oh I had no idea she exclaimed getting very red and then without a word of greeting she reopened the piano Cecil should have the Parsifal and anything else that he liked Our performer has changed her mind said Miss Bartlett perhaps implying she will play the music to Mr Emerson Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens song very badly and then she stopped I vote tennis said Freddy disgusted at the scrappy entertainment Yes so do I Once more she closed the unfortunate piano I vote you have a mens four All right Not for me thank you said Cecil I will not spoil the set He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth Oh come along Cecil Im bad Floyds rotten and so I dare says Emerson George corrected him I am not bad One looked down ones nose at this Then certainly I wont play said Cecil while Miss Bartlett under the impression that she was snubbing George added I agree with you Mr Vyse You had much better not play Much better not Minnie rushing in where Cecil feared to tread announced that she would play I shall miss every ball anyway so what does it matter But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion Then it will have to be Lucy said Mrs Honeychurch you must fall back on Lucy There is no other way out of it Lucy go and change your frock Lucys Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon As she changed her frock she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him Mr Floyd was her partner She liked music but how much better tennis seemed How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child George served and surprised her by his anxiety to win She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldnt fit how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her I shall want to live I tell you He wanted to live now to win at tennis to stand for all he was worth in the sunthe sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes and he did win Ah how beautiful the Weald looked The hills stood out above its radiance as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain and the South Downs if one chose were the mountains of Carrara She might be forgetting her Italy but she was noticing more things in her England One could play a new game with the view and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence Ah how beautiful the Weald looked But now Cecil claimed her He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood and would not sympathize with exaltation He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out I say listen to this Lucy Three split infinitives Dreadful said Lucy and missed her stroke When they had finished their set he still went on reading there was some murder scene and really everyone must listen to it Freddy and Mr Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels but the other two acquiesced The scene is laid in Florence What fun Cecil Read away Come Mr Emerson sit down after all your energy She had forgiven George as she put it and she made a point of being pleasant to him He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking Youand are you tired Of course Im not Do you mind being beaten She was going to answer No when it struck her that she did mind so she answered Yes She added merrily I dont see youre such a splendid player though The light was behind you and it was in my eyes I never said I was Why you did You didnt attend You saidoh dont go in for accuracy at this house We all exaggerate and we get very angry with people who dont The scene is laid in Florence repeated Cecil with an upward note Lucy recollected herself Sunset Leonora was speeding Lucy interrupted Leonora Is Leonora the heroine Whos the book by Joseph Emery Prank Sunset Leonora speeding across the square Pray the saints she might not arrive too late Sunsetthe sunset of Italy Under Orcagnas Loggiathe Loggia de Lanzi as we sometimes call it now Lucy burst into laughter Joseph Emery Prank indeed Why its Miss Lavish Its Miss Lavishs novel and shes publishing it under somebody elses name Who may Miss Lavish be Oh a dreadful personMr Emerson you remember Miss Lavish Excited by her pleasant afternoon she clapped her hands George looked up Of course I do I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street It was she who told me that you lived here Werent you pleased She meant to see Miss Lavish but when he bent down to the grass without replying it struck her that she could mean something else She watched his head which was almost resting against her knee and she thought that the ears were reddening No wonder the novels bad she added I never liked Miss Lavish But I suppose one ought to read it as ones met her All modern books are bad said Cecil who was annoyed at her inattention and vented his annoyance on literature Every one writes for money in these days Oh Cecil It is so I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer Cecil this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable but they did not affect her She had dwelt amongst melody and movement and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his Leaving him to be annoyed she gazed at the black head again She did not want to stroke it but she saw herself wanting to stroke it the sensation was curious How do you like this view of ours Mr Emerson I never notice much difference in views What do you mean Because theyre all alike Because all that matters in them is distance and air Hm said Cecil uncertain whether the remark was striking or not My fatherhe looked up at her and he was a little flushedsays that there is only one perfect viewthe view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it I expect your father has been reading Dante said Cecil fingering the novel which alone permitted him to lead the conversation He told us another day that views are really crowdscrowds of trees and houses and hillsand are bound to resemble each other like human crowdsand that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason Lucys lips parted For a crowd is more than the people who make it up Something gets added to itno one knows howjust as something has got added to those hills He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs What a splendid idea she murmured I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again Im so sorry hes not so well No he isnt well Theres an absurd account of a view in this book said Cecil Also that men fall into two classesthose who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms Mr Emerson have you any brothers or sisters None Why You spoke of us My mother I was meaning Cecil closed the novel with a bang Oh Cecilhow you made me jump I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead It is the first thing that I remember Cecil got up the man was illbredhe hadnt put on his coat after tennishe didnt do He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him Cecil do read the thing about the view Not while Mr Emerson is here to entertain us Noread away I think nothings funnier than to hear silly things read out loud If Mr Emerson thinks us frivolous he can go This struck Cecil as subtle and pleased him It put their visitor in the position of a prig Somewhat mollified he sat down again Mr Emerson go and find tennis balls She opened the book Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked But her attention wandered to Georges mother whoaccording to Mr Eagerhad been murdered in the sight of God andaccording to her sonhad seen as far as Hindhead Am I really to go asked George No of course not really she answered Chapter two said Cecil yawning Find me chapter two if it isnt bothering you Chapter two was found and she glanced at its opening sentences She thought she had gone mad Herehand me the book She heard her voice saying It isnt worth readingits too silly to readI never saw such rubbishit oughtnt to be allowed to be printed He took the book from her Leonora he read sat pensive and alone Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany dotted over with many a smiling village The season was spring Miss Lavish knew somehow and had printed the past in draggled prose for Cecil to read and for George to hear A golden haze he read He read Afar off the towers of Florence while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face He read There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use No eloquence was his nor did he suffer from the lack of it He simply enfolded her in his manly arms This isnt the passage I wanted he informed them there is another much funnier further on He turned over the leaves Should we go in to tea said Lucy whose voice remained steady She led the way up the garden Cecil following her George last She thought a disaster was averted But when they entered the shrubbery it came The book as if it had not worked mischief enough had been forgotten and Cecil must go back for it and George who loved passionately must blunder against her in the narrow path No she gasped and for the second time was kissed by him As if no more was possible he slipped back Cecil rejoined her they reached the upper lawn alone Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring That is to say she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove Though the danger was greater she was not shaken by deep sobs She said to Cecil I am not coming in to teatell motherI must write some letters and went up to her room Then she prepared for action Love felt and returned love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet reappeared now as the worlds enemy and she must stifle it She sent for Miss Bartlett The contest lay not between love and duty Perhaps there never is such a contest It lay between the real and the pretended and Lucys first aim was to defeat herself As her brain clouded over as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves She conquered her breakdown Tampering with the truth she forgot that the truth had ever been Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George he was nothing to her he never had been anything he had behaved abominably she had never encouraged him The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness and hides a man not only from others but from his own soul In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle Something too awful has happened she began as soon as her cousin arrived Do you know anything about Miss Lavishs novel Miss Bartlett looked surprised and said that she had not read the book nor known that it was published Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart There is a scene in it The hero and heroine make love Do you know about that Dear Do you know about it please she repeated They are on a hillside and Florence is in the distance My good Lucia I am all at sea I know nothing about it whatever There are violets I cannot believe it is a coincidence Charlotte Charlotte how could you have told her I have thought before speaking it must be you Told her what she asked with growing agitation About that dreadful afternoon in February Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved Oh Lucy dearest girlshe hasnt put that in her book Lucy nodded Not so that one could recognize it Yes Then nevernevernever more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine So you did tell I did just happenwhen I had tea with her at Romein the course of conversation But Charlottewhat about the promise you gave me when we were packing Why did you tell Miss Lavish when you wouldnt even let me tell mother I will never forgive Eleanor She has betrayed my confidence Why did you tell her though This is a most serious thing Why does any one tell anything The question is eternal and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response She had done wrongshe admitted it she only hoped that she had not done harm she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence Lucy stamped with irritation Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr Emerson it upset Mr Emerson and he insulted me again Behind Cecils back Ugh Is it possible that men are such brutes Behind Cecils back as we were walking up the garden Miss Bartlett burst into selfaccusations and regrets What is to be done now Can you tell me Oh LucyI shall never forgive myself never to my dying day Fancy if your prospects I know said Lucy wincing at the word I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil and what you meant by some other source You knew that you had told Miss Lavish and that she was not reliable It was Miss Bartletts turn to wince However said the girl despising her cousins shiftiness Whats dones done You have put me in a most awkward position How am I to get out of it Miss Bartlett could not think The days of her energy were over She was a visitor not a chaperon and a discredited visitor at that She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage He mustthat man must have such a setting down that he wont forget And whos to give it him I cant tell mother nowowing to you Nor Cecil Charlotte owing to you I am caught up every way I think I shall go mad I have no one to help me Thats why Ive sent for you Whats wanted is a man with a whip Miss Bartlett agreed one wanted a man with a whip Yesbut its no good agreeing Whats to be done We women go maundering on What does a girl do when she comes across a cad I always said he was a cad dear Give me credit for that at all events From the very first momentwhen he said his father was having a bath Oh bother the credit and whos been right or wrong Weve both made a muddle of it George Emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isnt he I want to know Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless Her own exposure had unnerved her and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain She moved feebly to the window and tried to detect the cads white flannels among the laurels You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome Cant you speak again to him now Willingly would I move heaven and earth I want something more definite said Lucy contemptuously Will you speak to him It is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine Really Charlotte was outdoing herself Yes or no please yes or no It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand Very well said Lucy with an angry gesture No one will help me I will speak to him myself And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along Hullo Emerson called Freddy from below Found the lost ball Good man Want any tea And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace Oh Lucy but that is brave of you I admire you They had gathered round George who beckoned she felt over the rubbish the sloppy thoughts the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul Her anger faded at the sight of him Ah The Emersons were fine people in their way She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying Freddy has taken him into the diningroom The others are going down the garden Come Let us get this over quickly Come I want you in the room of course Lucy do you mind doing it How can you ask such a ridiculous question Poor Lucy She stretched out her hand I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go Lucy nodded She remembered their last evening at Florencethe packing the candle the shadow of Miss Bartletts toque on the door She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time Eluding her cousins caress she led the way downstairs Try the jam Freddy was saying The jams jolly good George looking big and dishevelled was pacing up and down the diningroom As she entered he stopped and said Nonothing to eat You go down to the others said Lucy Charlotte and I will give Mr Emerson all he wants Wheres mother Shes started on her Sunday writing Shes in the drawingroom Thats all right You go away He went off singing Lucy sat down at the table Miss Bartlett who was thoroughly frightened took up a book and pretended to read She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech She just said I cant have it Mr Emerson I cannot even talk to you Go out of this house and never come into it again as long as I live here flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door I hate a row Go please What No discussion But I cant She shook her head Go please I do not want to call in Mr Vyse You dont mean he said absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlettyou dont mean that you are going to marry that man The line was unexpected She shrugged her shoulders as if his vulgarity wearied her You are merely ridiculous she said quietly Then his words rose gravely over hers You cannot live with Vyse Hes only for an acquaintance He is for society and cultivated talk He should know no one intimately least of all a woman It was a new light on Cecils character Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired I can scarcely discuss No but have you ever He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to thingsbooks picturesbut kill when they come to people Thats why Ill speak out through all this muddle even now Its shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person I would never have let myself go But I saw him first in the National Gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters Then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour That is the man all overplaying tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find Next I meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no Cecil all over again He darent let a woman decide Hes the type whos kept Europe back for a thousand years Every moment of his life hes forming you telling you whats charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own So it was at the Rectory when I met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon Thereforenot therefore I kissed you because the book made me do that and I wish to goodness I had more selfcontrol Im not ashamed I dont apologize But it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that I love you Or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly But thereforetherefore I settled to fight him Lucy thought of a very good remark You say Mr Vyse wants me to listen to him Mr Emerson Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality He said Yes I have and sank down as if suddenly weary Im the same kind of brute at bottom This desire to govern a womanit lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden But I do love you surely in a better way than he does He thought Yesreally in a better way I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms He stretched them towards her Lucy be quicktheres no time for us to talk nowcome to me as you came in the spring and afterwards I will be gentle and explain I have cared for you since that man died I cannot live without you No good I thought she is marrying someone else but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered I called I wanted to live and have my chance of joy And Mr Vyse said Lucy who kept commendably calm Does he not matter That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly A detail of no importance I suppose But he stretched his arms over the table towards her May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition He said It is our last chance I shall do all that I can And as if he had done all else he turned to Miss Bartlett who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening You wouldnt stop us this second time if you understood he said I have been into the dark and I am going back into it unless you will try to understand Her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards as though demolishing some invisible obstacle She did not answer It is being young he said quietly picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really It is that love and youth matter intellectually In silence the two women watched him His last remark they knew was nonsense but was he going after it or not Would not he the cad the charlatan attempt a more dramatic finish No He was apparently content He left them carefully closing the front door and when they looked through the hall window they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house Their tongues were loosed and they burst into stealthy rejoicings Oh Luciacome back hereoh what an awful man Lucy had no reactionat least not yet Well he amuses me she said Either Im mad or else he is and Im inclined to think its the latter One more fuss through with you Charlotte Many thanks I think though that this is the last My admirer will hardly trouble me again And Miss Bartlett too essayed the roguish Well it isnt everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it Oh one oughtnt to laugh really It might have been very serious But you were so sensible and braveso unlike the girls of my day Lets go down to them But once in the open air she paused Some emotionpity terror love but the emotion was strongseized her and she was aware of autumn Summer was ending and the evening brought her odours of decay the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring That something or other mattered intellectually A leaf violently agitated danced past her while other leaves lay motionless That the earth was hastening to reenter darkness and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner Hullo Lucy Theres still light enough for another set if you twoll hurry Mr Emerson has had to go What a nuisance That spoils the four I say Cecil do play do theres a good chap Its Floyds last day Do play tennis with us just this once Cecils voice came My dear Freddy I am no athlete As you well remarked this very morning There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books I plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you The scales fell from Lucys eyes How had she stood Cecil for a moment He was absolutely intolerable and the same evening she broke off her engagement Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered He had nothing to say He was not even angry but stood with a glass of whiskey between his hands trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion She had chosen the moment before bed when in accordance with their bourgeois habit she always dispensed drinks to the men Freddy and Mr Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses while Cecil invariably lingered sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard I am very sorry about it she said I have carefully thought things over We are too different I must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl It was a suitable speech but she was more angry than sorry and her voice showed it Differenthowhow I havent had a really good education for one thing she continued still on her knees by the sideboard My Italian trip came too late and I am forgetting all that I learnt there I shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should I dont understand you You arent like yourself Youre tired Lucy Tired she retorted kindling at once That is exactly like you You always think women dont mean what they say Well you sound tired as if something has worried you What if I do It doesnt prevent me from realizing the truth I cant marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day You had that bad headache yesterdayAll rightfor she had exclaimed indignantly I see its much more than headaches But give me a moments time He closed his eyes You must excuse me if I say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces Part of it lives three minutes back when I was sure that you loved me and the other partI find it difficultI am likely to say the wrong thing It struck her that he was not behaving so badly and her irritation increased She again desired a struggle not a discussion To bring on the crisis she said There are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them Things must come to a breakingpoint some time and it happens to be today If you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to youwhen you wouldnt play tennis with Freddy I never do play tennis said Cecil painfully bewildered I never could play I dont understand a word you say You can play well enough to make up a four I thought it abominably selfish of you No I cantwell never mind the tennis Why couldnt youcouldnt you have warned me if you felt anything wrong You talked of our wedding at lunchat least you let me talk I knew you wouldnt understand said Lucy quite crossly I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations Of course it isnt the tennisthat was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain She developed this position Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wifefor instance in London and are you fitted to be my husband I dont think so You dont like Freddy nor my mother There was always a lot against our engagement Cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it untilwell until all things came to a point They have today I see clearly I must speak Thats all I cannot think you were right said Cecil gently I cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true I feel that you are not treating me fairly Its all too horrible Whats the good of a scene No good But surely I have a right to hear a little more He put down his glass and opened the window From where she knelt jangling her keys she could see a slit of darkness and peering into it as if it would tell him that little more his long thoughtful face Dont open the window and youd better draw the curtain too Freddy or any one might be outside He obeyed I really think we had better go to bed if you dont mind I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards As you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking But to Cecil now that he was about to lose her she seemed each moment more desirable He looked at her instead of through her for the first time since they were engaged From a Leonardo she had become a living woman with mysteries and forces of her own with qualities that even eluded art His brain recovered from the shock and in a burst of genuine devotion he cried But I love you and I did think you loved me I did not she said I thought I did at first I am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too He began to walk up and down the room and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour She had counted on his being petty It would have made things easier for her By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition You dont love me evidently I dare say you are right not to But it would hurt a little less if I knew why Becausea phrase came to her and she accepted ityoure the sort who cant know any one intimately A horrified look came into his eyes I dont mean exactly that But you will question me though I beg you not to and I must say something It is that more or less When we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now youre always protecting me Her voice swelled I wont be protected I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right To shield me is an insult Cant I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it secondhand through you A womans place You despise my motherI know you dobecause shes conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodnessshe rose to her feetconventional Cecil youre that for you may understand beautiful things but you dont know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me I wont be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me Thats why I break off my engagement You were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people She stopped There was a pause Then Cecil said with great emotion It is true True on the whole she corrected full of some vague shame True every word It is a revelation It isI Anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife He repeated The sort that can know no one intimately It is true I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother You are even greater than I thought She withdrew a step Im not going to worry you You are far too good to me I shall never forget your insight and dear I only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldnt marry me and so have given me a chance to improve I have never known you till this evening I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be But this evening you are a different person new thoughtseven a new voice What do you mean by a new voice she asked seized with incontrollable anger I mean that a new person seems speaking through you said he Then she lost her balance She cried If you think I am in love with some one else you are very much mistaken Of course I dont think that You are not that kind Lucy Oh yes you do think it Its your old idea the idea that has kept Europe backI mean the idea that women are always thinking of men If a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says Oh she had someone else in her mind she hopes to get someone else Its disgusting brutal As if a girl cant break it off for the sake of freedom He answered reverently I may have said that in the past I shall never say it again You have taught me better She began to redden and pretended to examine the windows again Of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadnt known of up till now All right Cecil that will do Dont apologize to me It was my mistake It is a question between ideals yours and minepure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler I was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new His voice broke I must actually thank you for what you have donefor showing me what I really am Solemnly I thank you for showing me a true woman Will you shake hands Of course I will said Lucy twisting up her other hand in the curtains Goodnight Cecil Goodbye Thats all right Im sorry about it Thank you very much for your gentleness Let me light your candle shall I They went into the hall Thank you Goodnight again God bless you Lucy Goodbye Cecil She watched him steal upstairs while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation and gave her a look of memorable beauty For all his culture Cecil was an ascetic at heart and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it She could never marry In the tumult of her soul that stood firm Cecil believed in her she must some day believe in herself She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently who care for liberty and not for men she must forget that George loved her that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release that George had gone away intowhat was itthe darkness She put out the lamp It did not do to think nor for the matter of that to feel She gave up trying to understand herself and joined the vast armies of the benighted who follow neither the heart nor the brain and march to their destiny by catchwords The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk But they have yielded to the only enemy that mattersthe enemy within They have sinned against passion and truth and vain will be their strife after virtue As the years pass they are censured Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks their wit becomes cynicism their unselfishness hypocrisy they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene and not by any heavenly intervention but by the ordinary course of nature those allied deities will be avenged Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one The night received her as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr Beebe Mrs Honeychurch Freddy and The Servants Windy Corner lay not on the summit of the ridge but a few hundred feet down the southern slope at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill On either side of it was a shallow ravine filled with ferns and pinetrees and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald Whenever Mr Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth and poised in the middle of them Windy Cornerhe laughed The situation was so glorious the house so commonplace not to say impertinent The late Mr Honeychurch had affected the cube because it gave him the most accommodation for his money and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret shaped like a rhinoceros horn where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road So impertinentand yet the house did for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously yet all these suggested the accidental the temporary while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Natures own creation One might laugh at the house but one never shuddered Mr Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip He had heard from the Miss Alans These admirable ladies since they could not go to Cissie Villa had changed their plans They were going to Greece instead Since Florence did my poor sister so much good wrote Miss Catharine we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter Of course Athens is a plunge and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread but after all we can take that with us and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train But is there an English Church And the letter went on to say I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople we should be so grateful Lucy would enjoy this letter and the smile with which Mr Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her She would see the fun of it and some of its beauty for she must see some beauty Though she was hopeless about pictures and though she dressed so unevenlyoh that cerise frock yesterday at churchshe must see some beauty in life or she could not play the piano as she did He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends that their psychology is a modern development and has not yet been understood This theory had he known it had possibly just been illustrated by facts Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea to see his niece and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner and just as he caught sight of the house it started bowled up the drive and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road Therefore it must be the horse who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him The door opened obediently and two men emerged whom Mr Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy They were an odd couple to go driving but he saw a trunk beside the coachmans legs Cecil who wore a bowler must be going away while Freddy a capwas seeing him to the station They walked rapidly taking the short cuts and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road They shook hands with the clergyman but did not speak So youre off for a minute Mr Vyse he asked Cecil said Yes while Freddy edged away I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch He quoted from it Isnt it wonderful Isnt it romance Most certainly they will go to Constantinople They are taken in a snare that cannot fail They will end by going round the world Cecil listened civilly and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested Isnt Romance capricious I never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing A really comfortable pension at Constantinople So they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans They want the Pension Keats Im awfully sorry to interrupt Mr Beebe said Freddy but have you any matches I have said Cecil and it did not escape Mr Beebes notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly You have never met these Miss Alans have you Mr Vyse Never Then you dont see the wonder of this Greek visit I havent been to Greece myself and dont mean to go and I cant imagine any of my friends going It is altogether too big for our little lot Dont you think so Italy is just about as much as we can manage Italy is heroic but Greece is godlike or devilishI am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus All right FreddyI am not being clever upon my word I am notI took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when youve done with them He lit a cigarette and went on talking to the two young men I was saying if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background let it be Italian Big enough in all conscience The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me There the contrast is just as much as I can realize But not the Parthenon not the frieze of Phidias at any price and here comes the victoria Youre quite right said Cecil Greece is not for our little lot and he got in Freddy followed nodding to the clergyman whom he trusted not to be pulling ones leg really And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out and came running back for Vyses matchbox which had not been returned As he took it he said Im so glad you only talked about books Cecils hard hit Lucy wont marry him If youd gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down But when Late last night I must go Perhaps they wont want me down there Nogo on Goodbye Thank goodness exclaimed Mr Beebe to himself and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly It was the one foolish thing she ever did Oh what a glorious riddance And after a little thought he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner light of heart The house was again as it ought to becut off forever from Cecils pretentious world He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden In the drawingroom Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata He hesitated a moment but went down the garden as requested There he found a mournful company It was a blustering day and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias Mrs Honeychurch who looked cross was tying them up while Miss Bartlett unsuitably dressed impeded her with offers of assistance At a little distance stood Minnie and the gardenchild a minute importation each holding either end of a long piece of bass Oh how do you do Mr Beebe Gracious what a mess everything is Look at my scarlet pompoms and the wind blowing your skirts about and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in and then the carriage having to go out when I had counted on having Powell whogive everyone their duedoes tie up dahlias properly Evidently Mrs Honeychurch was shattered How do you do said Miss Bartlett with a meaning glance as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales Here Lennie the bass cried Mrs Honeychurch The gardenchild who did not know what bass was stood rooted to the path with horror Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable today and that it was not her fault if dahliastrings would tear longways instead of across Come for a walk with me he told her You have worried them as much as they can stand Mrs Honeychurch I only called in aimlessly I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern if I may Oh must you Yes doNot the scissors thank you Charlotte when both my hands are full alreadyIm perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it Mr Beebe who was an adept at relieving situations invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity Yes Charlotte I dont want youdo go theres nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed but when she had exasperated everyone except Minnie by a refusal she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance As they walked up the garden the orange cactus fell and Mr Beebes last vision was of the gardenchild clasping it like a lover his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom It is terrible this havoc among the flowers he remarked It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment enunciated Miss Bartlett Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother Or will she come with us I think we had better leave Lucy to herself and to her own pursuits Theyre angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast whispered Minnie and Floyd has gone and Mr Vyse has gone and Freddy wont play with me In fact Uncle Arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday Dont be a prig said her Uncle Arthur Go and put on your boots He stepped into the drawingroom where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart She stopped when he entered How do you do Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive Would you come too I dont think I will thank you No I didnt suppose you would care to much Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords How delicate those Sonatas are said Mr Beebe though at the bottom of his heart he thought them silly little things Lucy passed into Schumann Miss Honeychurch Yes I met them on the hill Your brother told me Oh he did She sounded annoyed Mr Beebe felt hurt for he had thought that she would like him to be told I neednt say that it will go no further Mother Charlotte Cecil Freddy you said Lucy playing a note for each person who knew and then playing a sixth note If youll let me say so I am very glad and I am certain that you have done the right thing So I hoped other people would think but they dont seem to I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise So does mother Mother minds dreadfully I am very sorry for that said Mr Beebe with feeling Mrs Honeychurch who hated all changes did mind but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended and only for the minute It was really a ruse of Lucys to justify her despondencya ruse of which she was not herself conscious for she was marching in the armies of darkness And Freddy minds Still Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much did he I gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you Boys are so odd Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel Mr Beebe saw that Lucyvery properlydid not wish to discuss her action so after a sincere expression of sympathy he said I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan That was really what brought me over I thought it might amuse you all How delightful said Lucy in a dull voice For the sake of something to do he began to read her the letter After a few words her eyes grew alert and soon she interrupted him with Going abroad When do they start Next week I gather Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back No he didnt Because I do hope he wont go gossiping So she did want to talk about her broken engagement Always complaisant he put the letter away But she at once exclaimed in a high voice Oh do tell me more about the Miss Alans How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad I want them to start from Venice and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast She laughed heartily Oh delightful I wish theyd take me Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel Perhaps George Emerson is right He says that Italy is only an euphuism for Fate Oh not Italy but Constantinople I have always longed to go to Constantinople Constantinople is practically Asia isnt it Mr Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens with Delphi perhaps if the roads are safe But this made no difference to her enthusiasm She had always longed to go to Greece even more it seemed He saw to his surprise that she was apparently serious I didnt realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends after Cissie Villa Oh thats nothing I assure you Cissie Villas nothing to me I would give anything to go with them Would your mother spare you again so soon You have scarcely been home three months She must spare me cried Lucy in growing excitement I simply must go away I have to She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair Dont you see that I have to go away I didnt realize at the timeand of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel Yes yes I knew youd understand Mr Beebe did not quite understand Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line and was not going to annoy her Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying He hinted this to her and she accepted the hint eagerly Yes of course to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down I am afraid it has been a bothersome business he said gently No not at all Cecil was very kind indeed onlyI had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a littleit was that he is so masterful I found that he wouldnt let me go my own way He would improve me in places where I cant be improved Cecil wont let a woman decide for herselfin fact he darent What nonsense I do talk But that is the kind of thing It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr Vyse it is what I gather from all that I have known of you I do sympathize and agree most profoundly I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism Is it worth while rushing off to Greece But I must go somewhere she cried I have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing She struck her knees with clenched fists and repeated I must And the time I shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring You all think much too highly of me I wish you werent so kind At this moment Miss Bartlett entered and her nervousness increased I must get away ever so far I must know my own mind and where I want to go Come along tea tea tea said Mr Beebe and bustled his guests out of the frontdoor He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat When he returned for it he heard to his relief and surprise the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata She is playing again he said to Miss Bartlett Lucy can always play was the acid reply One is very thankful that she has such a resource She is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be I know all about it The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle and he prepared for a discussion He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett As he had put it to himself at Florence she might yet reveal depths of strangeness if not of meaning But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable He assumed that much and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns She opened the discussion with We had much better let the matter drop I wonder It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street It would be death to gossip about Mr Vyses dismissal at the present moment Mr Beebe raised his eyebrows Death is a strong wordsurely too strong There was no question of tragedy He said Of course Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind I know said Miss Bartlett civilly Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you One cannot be too careful Quite so I do implore absolute secrecy A chance word to a chattering friend and Exactly He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words A rector lives in a web of petty secrets and confidences and warnings and the wiser he is the less he will regard them He will change the subject as did Mr Beebe saying cheerfully Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish It is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one anothers lives Two three four six of usno eight I had forgotten the Emersonshave kept more or less in touch We must really give the Signora a testimonial And Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern On the summit they paused The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white which stretched and shredded and tore slowly until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue Summer was retreating The wind roared the trees groaned yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven The weather was breaking up breaking broken and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery Mr Beebes eyes rested on Windy Corner where Lucy sat practising Mozart No smile came to his lips and changing the subject again he said We shant have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on The darkness last night was appalling They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five oclock That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room and have tea at a table comfortably Mr Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in so he proposed a division of forces They would hand the child her food through the window Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy I have been thinking Miss Bartlett he said and unless you very much object I would like to reopen that discussion She bowed Nothing about the past I know little and care less about that I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousins credit She has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her But the future Seriously what do you think of this Greek plan He pulled out the letter again I dont know whether you overheard but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career Its allI cant explainits wrong Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence laid it down seemed to hesitate and then read it again I cant see the point of it myself To his astonishment she replied There I cannot agree with you In it I spy Lucys salvation Really Now why She wanted to leave Windy Corner I knowbut it seems so odd so unlike her soI was going to sayselfish It is natural surelyafter such painful scenesthat she should desire a change Here apparently was one of those points that the male intellect misses Mr Beebe exclaimed So she says herself and since another lady agrees with her I must own that I am partially convinced Perhaps she must have a change I have no sisters orand I dont understand these things But why need she go as far as Greece You may well ask that replied Miss Bartlett who was evidently interested and had almost dropped her evasive manner Why Greece What is it Minnie dearjam Why not Tunbridge Wells Oh Mr Beebe I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning I cannot help her I will say no more Perhaps I have already said too much I am not to talk I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells and she refused Mr Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife But my feelings are of no importance I know too well that I get on Lucys nerves Our tour was a failure She wanted to leave Florence and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome and all the time I felt that I was spending her mothers money Let us keep to the future though interrupted Mr Beebe I want your advice Very well said Charlotte with a choky abruptness that was new to him though familiar to Lucy I for one will help her to go to Greece Will you Mr Beebe considered It is absolutely necessary she continued lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion an intensity that surprised him I knowI know The darkness was coming on and he felt that this odd woman really did know She must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes I trust that the servants know nothing Afterwardsbut I may have said too much already Only Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs Honeychurch alone If you help we may succeed Otherwise Otherwise Otherwise she repeated as if the word held finality Yes I will help her said the clergyman setting his jaw firm Come let us go back now and settle the whole thing up Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude The tavern signa beehive trimmed evenly with beescreaked in the wind outside as she thanked him Mr Beebe did not quite understand the situation but then he did not desire to understand it nor to jump to the conclusion of another man that would have attracted a grosser mind He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form Its very vagueness spurred him into knighterrantry His belief in celibacy so reticent so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower They that marry do well but they that refrain do better So ran his belief and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure In the case of Lucy the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil and he was willing to go furtherto place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement Yet it existed and it alone explains his action subsequently and his influence on the action of others The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern was to help not only Lucy but religion also They hurried home through a world of black and grey He conversed on indifferent topics the Emersons need of a housekeeper servants Italian servants novels about Italy novels with a purpose could literature influence life Windy Corner glimmered In the garden Mrs Honeychurch now helped by Freddy still wrestled with the lives of her flowers It gets too dark she said hopelessly This comes of putting off We might have known the weather would break up soon and now Lucy wants to go to Greece I dont know what the worlds coming to Mrs Honeychurch he said go to Greece she must Come up to the house and lets talk it over Do you in the first place mind her breaking with Vyse Mr Beebe Im thankfulsimply thankful So am I said Freddy Good Now come up to the house They conferred in the diningroom for half an hour Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone It was expensive and dramaticboth qualities that her mother loathed Nor would Charlotte have succeeded The honours of the day rested with Mr Beebe By his tact and common sense and by his influence as a clergymanfor a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs Honeychurch greatlyhe bent her to their purpose I dont see why Greece is necessary she said but as you do I suppose it is all right It must be something I cant understand Lucy Lets tell her Lucy She is playing the piano Mr Beebe said He opened the door and heard the words of a song Look not thou on beautys charming I didnt know that Miss Honeychurch sang too Sit thou still when kings are arming Taste not when the winecup glistens Its a song that Cecil gave her How odd girls are Whats that called Lucy stopping short All right dear said Mrs Honeychurch kindly She went into the drawingroom and Mr Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say I am sorry I was so cross about Greece but it came on the top of the dahlias Rather a hard voice said Thank you mother that doesnt matter a bit And you are right tooGreece will be all right you can go if the Miss Alans will have you Oh splendid Oh thank you Mr Beebe followed Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys She was glad but he had expected greater gladness Her mother bent over her Freddy to whom she had been singing reclined on the floor with his head against her and an unlit pipe between his lips Oddly enough the group was beautiful Mr Beebe who loved the art of the past was reminded of a favourite theme the Santa Conversazione in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble thingsa theme neither sensual nor sensational and therefore ignored by the art of today Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home Taste not when the winecup glistens Speak not when the people listens she continued Heres Mr Beebe Mr Beebe knows my rude ways Its a beautiful song and a wise one said he Go on It isnt very good she said listlessly I forget whyharmony or something I suspected it was unscholarly Its so beautiful The tunes right enough said Freddy but the words are rotten Why throw up the sponge How stupidly you talk said his sister The Santa Conversazione was broken up After all there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother so he said goodbye Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch and with his usual felicity of phrase said This has been a day and a half Stop thine ear against the singer Wait a minute she is finishing From the red gold keep thy finger Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die I love weather like this said Freddy Mr Beebe passed into it The two main facts were clear She had behaved splendidly and he had helped her He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girls life If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled he must acquiesce she was choosing the better part Vacant heart and hand and eye Perhaps the song stated the better part rather too strongly He half fancied that the soaring accompanimentwhich he did not lose in the shout of the galereally agreed with Freddy and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die However for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below himnow as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness Chapter XIX Lying to Mr Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsburya clean airless establishment much patronized by provincial England They always perched there before crossing the great seas and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes guidebooks mackintosh squares digestive bread and other Continental necessaries That there are shops abroad even in Athens never occurred to them for they regarded travel as a species of warfare only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores Miss Honeychurch they trusted would take care to equip herself duly Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids paper soap was a great help towards freshening up ones face in the train Lucy promised a little depressed But of course you know all about these things and you have Mr Vyse to help you A gentleman is such a standby Mrs Honeychurch who had come up to town with her daughter began to drum nervously upon her cardcase We think it so good of Mr Vyse to spare you Miss Catharine continued It is not every young man who would be so unselfish But perhaps he will come out and join you later on Or does his work keep him in London said Miss Teresa the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters However we shall see him when he sees you off I do so long to see him No one will see Lucy off interposed Mrs Honeychurch She doesnt like it No I hate seeingsoff said Lucy Really How funny I should have thought that in this case Oh Mrs Honeychurch you arent going It is such a pleasure to have met you They escaped and Lucy said with relief Thats all right We just got through that time But her mother was annoyed I should be told dear that I am unsympathetic But I cannot see why you didnt tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it There all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too I dare say which is most unpleasant Lucy had plenty to say in reply She described the Miss Alans character they were such gossips and if one told them the news would be everywhere in no time But why shouldnt it be everywhere in no time Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England I shall tell them then Its much pleasanter How wet it is Lets turn in here Here was the British Museum Mrs Honeychurch refused If they must take shelter let it be in a shop Lucy felt contemptuous for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods Oh well let it be shop then Lets go to Mudies Ill buy a guidebook You know Lucy you and Charlotte and Mr Beebe all tell me Im so stupid so I suppose I am but I shall never understand this holeandcorner work Youve got rid of Cecilwell and good and Im thankful hes gone though I did feel angry for the minute But why not announce it Why this hushing up and tiptoeing Its only for a few days But why at all Lucy was silent She was drifting away from her mother It was quite easy to say Because George Emerson has been bothering me and if he hears Ive given up Cecil may begin againquite easy and it had the incidental advantage of being true But she could not say it She disliked confidences for they might lead to selfknowledge and to that king of terrorsLight Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul Mrs Honeychurch too was silent She was thinking My daughter wont answer me she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me Any rag tag and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long she burst out with Youre tired of Windy Corner This was perfectly true Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil but she discovered that her home existed no longer It might exist for Freddy who still lived and thought straight but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment and she was disordering the very instruments of life She only felt I do not love George I broke off my engagement because I did not love George I must go to Greece because I do not love George it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly She only felt irritable and petulant and anxious to do what she was not expected to do and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation Oh mother what rubbish you talk Of course Im not tired of Windy Corner Then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour She laughed faintly Half a minute would be nearer Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether Hush mother People will hear you for they had entered Mudies She bought Baedeker and then continued Of course I want to live at home but as we are talking about it I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been You see I come into my money next year Tears came into her mothers eyes Driven by nameless bewilderment by what is in older people termed eccentricity Lucy determined to make this point clear Ive seen the world so littleI felt so out of things in Italy I have seen so little of life one ought to come up to London morenot a cheap ticket like today but to stop I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl And mess with typewriters and latchkeys exploded Mrs Honeychurch And agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police And call it a Missionwhen no one wants you And call it Dutywhen it means that you cant stand your own home And call it Workwhen thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is And then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them I want more independence said Lucy lamely she knew that she wanted something and independence is a useful cry we can always say that we have not got it She tried to remember her emotions in Florence those had been sincere and passionate and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latchkeys But independence was certainly her cue Very well Take your independence and be gone Rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear viewand then share a flat with another girl Lucy screwed up her mouth and said Perhaps I spoke hastily Oh goodness her mother flashed How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett Charlotte flashed Lucy in her turn pierced at last by a vivid pain More every moment I dont know what you mean mother Charlotte and I are not the very least alike Well I see the likeness The same eternal worrying the same taking back of words You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters What rubbish And if you dislike Charlotte so its rather a pity you asked her to stop I warned you about her I begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to There you go I beg your pardon Charlotte again my dear thats all her very words Lucy clenched her teeth My point is that you oughtnt to have asked Charlotte to stop I wish you would keep to the point And the conversation died off into a wrangle She and her mother shopped in silence spoke little in the train little again in the carriage which met them at Dorking Station It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the overhanging beechtrees and rattled on the hood Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy Leaning forward she looked out into the steaming dusk and watched the carriagelamp pass like a searchlight over mud and leaves and reveal nothing beautiful The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable she remarked For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street where she had been dropped as the carriage went down to pay a call on Mr Beebes old mother We shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isnt raining Oh for a little air Then she listened to the horses hoofsHe has not toldhe has not told That melody was blurred by the soft road Cant we have the hood down she demanded and her mother with sudden tenderness said Very well old lady stop the horse And the horse was stopped and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood and squirted water down Mrs Honeychurchs neck But now that the hood was down she did see something that she would have missedthere were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock Is that house to let again Powell she called Yes miss he replied Have they gone It is too far out of town for the young gentleman and his fathers rheumatism has come on so he cant stop on alone so they are trying to let furnished was the answer They have gone then Yes miss they have gone Lucy sank back The carriage stopped at the Rectory She got out to call for Miss Bartlett So the Emersons had gone and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary Waste That word seemed to sum up the whole of life Wasted plans wasted money wasted love and she had wounded her mother Was it possible that she had muddled things away Quite possible Other people had When the maid opened the door she was unable to speak and stared stupidly into the hall Miss Bartlett at once came forward and after a long preamble asked a great favour might she go to church Mr Beebe and his mother had already gone but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostesss full sanction for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more Certainly said the hostess wearily I forgot it was Friday Lets all go Powell can go round to the stables Lucy dearest No church for me thank you A sigh and they departed The church was invisible but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour This was a stained window through which some feeble light was shining and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr Beebes voice running through the litany to a minute congregation Even their church built upon the slope of the hill so artfully with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingleeven their church had lost its charm and the thing one never talked aboutreligionwas fading like all the other things She followed the maid into the Rectory Would she object to sitting in Mr Beebes study There was only that one fire She would not object Some one was there already for Lucy heard the words A lady to wait sir Old Mr Emerson was sitting by the fire with his foot upon a goutstool Oh Miss Honeychurch that you should come he quavered and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday Not a word would come to her lips George she had faced and could have faced again but she had forgotten how to treat his father Miss Honeychurch dear we are so sorry George is so sorry He thought he had a right to try I cannot blame my boy and yet I wish he had told me first He ought not to have tried I knew nothing about it at all If only she could remember how to behave He held up his hand But you must not scold him Lucy turned her back and began to look at Mr Beebes books I taught him he quavered to trust in love I said When love comes that is reality I said Passion does not blind No Passion is sanity and the woman you love she is the only person you will ever really understand He sighed True everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result Poor boy He is so sorry He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean Yethis voice gathered strength he spoke out to make certainMiss Honeychurch do you remember Italy Lucy selected a booka volume of Old Testament commentaries Holding it up to her eyes she said I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son But you do remember it He has misbehaved himself from the first I only was told that he loved you last Sunday I never could judge behaviour IIsuppose he has Feeling a little steadier she put the book back and turned round to him His face was drooping and swollen but his eyes though they were sunken deep gleamed with a childs courage Why he has behaved abominably she said I am glad he is sorry Do you know what he did Not abominably was the gentle correction He only tried when he should not have tried You have all you want Miss Honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love Do not go out of Georges life saying he is abominable No of course said Lucy ashamed at the reference to Cecil Abominable is much too strong I am sorry I used it about your son I think I will go to church after all My mother and my cousin have gone I shall not be so very late Especially as he has gone under he said quietly What was that Gone under naturally He beat his palms together in silence his head fell on his chest I dont understand As his mother did But Mr EmersonMr Emersonwhat are you talking about When I wouldnt have George baptized said he Lucy was frightened And she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round She thought it a judgement He shuddered Oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents Oh horribleworst of allworse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again A judgement And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church Is it possible Miss Honeychurch Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever I dont know gasped Lucy I dont understand this sort of thing I was not meant to understand it But Mr Eagerhe came when I was out and acted according to his principles I dont blame him or any one but by the time George was well she was ill He made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it It was thus that Mr Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God Oh how terrible said Lucy forgetting her own affairs at last He was not baptized said the old man I did hold firm And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books as ifat what costhe had won a victory over them My boy shall go back to the earth untouched She asked whether young Mr Emerson was ill Ohlast Sunday He started into the present George last Sundayno not ill just gone under He is never ill But he is his mothers son Her eyes were his and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live It was always touch and go He will live but he will not think it worth while to live He will never think anything worth while You remember that church at Florence Lucy did remember and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps After you left Florencehorrible Then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better You saw him bathing I am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair I am deeply sorry about it Then there came something about a novel I didnt follow it at all I had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old Ah well one must have failures George comes down tomorrow and takes me up to his London rooms He cant bear to be about here and I must be where he is Mr Emerson cried the girl dont leave at least not on my account I am going to Greece Dont leave your comfortable house It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled How good everyone is And look at Mr Beebe housing mecame over this morning and heard I was going Here I am so comfortable with a fire Yes but you wont go back to London Its absurd I must be with George I must make him care to live and down here he cant He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about youI am not justifying him I am only saying what has happened Oh Mr Emersonshe took hold of his handyou mustnt Ive been bother enough to the world by now I cant have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through itall on my account You must stop I am just going to Greece All the way to Greece Her manner altered To Greece So you must stop You wont talk about this business I know I can trust you both Certainly you can We either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen I shouldnt want I suppose Mr Vyse is very angry with George No it was wrong of George to try We have pushed our beliefs too far I fancy that we deserve sorrow She looked at the books againblack brown and that acrid theological blue They surrounded the visitors on every side they were piled on the tables they pressed against the very ceiling To Lucy who could not see that Mr Emerson was profoundly religious and differed from Mr Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passionit seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum when he was unhappy and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman More certain than ever that she was tired he offered her his chair No please sit still I think I will sit in the carriage Miss Honeychurch you do sound tired Not a bit said Lucy with trembling lips But you are and theres a look of George about you And what were you saying about going abroad She was silent Greeceand she saw that he was thinking the word overGreece but you were to be married this year I thought Not till January it wasnt said Lucy clasping her hands Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point I suppose that Mr Vyse is going with you I hopeit isnt because George spoke that you are both going No I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr Vyse Thank you At that moment Mr Beebe came back from church His cassock was covered with rain Thats all right he said kindly I counted on you two keeping each other company Its pouring again The entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it Did Powell go round I think so Ill see Noof course Ill see How are the Miss Alans Very well thank you Did you tell Mr Emerson about Greece II did Dont you think it very plucky of her Mr Emerson to undertake the two Miss Alans Now Miss Honeychurch go backkeep warm I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling And he hurried off to the stables He is not going she said hoarsely I made a slip Mr Vyse does stop behind in England Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man To George to Cecil she would have lied again but he seemed so near the end of things so dignified in his approach to the gulf of which he gave one account and the books that surrounded him another so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed that the true chivalrynot the wornout chivalry of sex but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the oldawoke in her and at whatever risk she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty and he lifting his eyes said You are leaving him You are leaving the man you love II had to Why Miss Honeychurch why Terror came over her and she lied again She made the long convincing speech that she had made to Mr Beebe and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more He heard her in silence and then said My dear I am worried about you It seems to medreamily she was not alarmedthat you are in a muddle She shook her head Take an old mans word theres nothing worse than a muddle in all the world It is easy to face Death and Fate and the things that sound so dreadful It is on my muddles that I look back with horroron the things that I might have avoided We can help one another but little I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life but I know better now and all my teaching of George has come down to this beware of muddle Do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and werent Do you remember before when you refused the room with the view Those were muddleslittle but ominousand I am fearing that you are in one now She was silent Dont trust me Miss Honeychurch Though life is very glorious it is difficult She was still silent Life wrote a friend of mine is a public performance on the violin in which you must learn the instrument as you go along I think he puts it well Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes alongespecially the function of Love Then he burst out excitedly Thats it thats what I mean You love George And after his long preamble the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea But you do he went on not waiting for contradiction You love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it You wont marry the other man for his sake How dare you gasped Lucy with the roaring of waters in her ears Oh how like a manI mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man But you are She summoned physical disgust Youre shocked but I mean to shock you Its the only hope at times I can reach you no other way You must marry or your life will be wasted You have gone too far to retreat I have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry I know that with George you will find them and that you love him Then be his wife He is already part of you Though you fly to Greece and never see him again or forget his very name George will work in your thoughts till you die It isnt possible to love and to part You will wish that it was You can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you I know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal Lucy began to cry with anger and though her anger passed away soon her tears remained I only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body Ah the misery that would be saved if we confessed that Ah for a little directness to liberate the soul Your soul dear Lucy I hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round But we have souls I cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and I see you ruining yours I cannot bear it It is again the darkness creeping in it is hell Then he checked himself What nonsense I have talkedhow abstract and remote And I have made you cry Dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy When I think what life is and how seldom love is answered by loveMarry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made She could not understand him the words were indeed remote Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn veil after veil and she saw to the bottom of her soul Then Lucy Youve frightened me she moaned CecilMr Beebethe tickets boughteverything She fell sobbing into the chair Im caught in the tangle I must suffer and grow old away from him I cannot break the whole of life for his sake They trusted me A carriage drew up at the frontdoor Give George my loveonce only Tell him muddle Then she arranged her veil while the tears poured over her cheeks inside Lucy Nothey are in the halloh please not Mr Emersonthey trust me But why should they when you have deceived them Mr Beebe opened the door saying Heres my mother Youre not worthy of their trust Whats that said Mr Beebe sharply I was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you One minute mother He came in and shut the door I dont follow you Mr Emerson To whom do you refer Trust whom I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George They have loved one another all along Mr Beebe looked at the sobbing girl He was very quiet and his white face with its ruddy whiskers seemed suddenly inhuman A long black column he stood and awaited her reply I shall never marry him quavered Lucy A look of contempt came over him and he said Why not Mr BeebeI have misled youI have misled myself Oh rubbish Miss Honeychurch It is not rubbish said the old man hotly Its the part of people that you dont understand Mr Beebe laid his hand on the old mans shoulder pleasantly Lucy Lucy called voices from the carriage Mr Beebe could you help me He looked amazed at the request and said in a low stern voice I am more grieved than I can possibly express It is lamentable lamentableincredible Whats wrong with the boy fired up the other again Nothing Mr Emerson except that he no longer interests me Marry George Miss Honeychurch He will do admirably He walked out and left them They heard him guiding his mother upstairs Lucy the voices called She turned to Mr Emerson in despair But his face revived her It was the face of a saint who understood Now it is all dark Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed I know But remember the mountains over Florence and the view Ah dear if I were George and gave you one kiss it would make you brave You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise George still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him Am I justified Into his own eyes tears came Yes for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure there is Truth Truth counts Truth does count You kiss me said the girl You kiss me I will try He gave her a sense of deities reconciled a feeling that in gaining the man she loved she would gain something for the whole world Throughout the squalor of her homeward driveshe spoke at oncehis salutation remained He had robbed the body of its taint the worlds taunts of their sting he had shown her the holiness of direct desire She never exactly understood she would say in after years how he managed to strengthen her It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece but they went by themselves They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf They alone will visit Athens and Delphi and either shrine of intellectual songthat upon the Acropolis encircled by blue seas that under Parnassus where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity Trembling anxious cumbered with much digestive bread they did proceed to Constantinople they did go round the world The rest of us must be contented with a fair but a less arduous goal Italiam petimus we return to the Pension Bertolini George said it was his old room No it isnt said Lucy because it is the room I had and I had your fathers room I forget why Charlotte made me for some reason He knelt on the tiled floor and laid his face in her lap George you baby get up Why shouldnt I be a baby murmured George Unable to answer this question she put down his sock which she was trying to mend and gazed out through the window It was evening and again the spring Oh bother Charlotte she said thoughtfully What can such people be made of Same stuff as parsons are made of Nonsense Quite right It is nonsense Now you get up off the cold floor or youll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly Why shouldnt I laugh he asked pinning her with his elbows and advancing his face to hers Whats there to cry at Kiss me here He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome He was a boy after all When it came to the point it was she who remembered the past she into whose soul the iron had entered she who knew whose room this had been last year It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong Any letters he asked Just a line from Freddy Now kiss me here then here Then threatened again with rheumatism he strolled to the window opened it as the English will and leant out There was the parapet there the river there to the left the beginnings of the hills The cabdriver who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago A passion of gratitudeall feelings grow to passions in the Southcame over the husband and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool He had helped himself it is true but how stupidly All the fighting that mattered had been done by othersby Italy by his father by his wife Lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows San Miniato Ill just finish your sock Signorino domani faremo uno giro called the cabman with engaging certainty George told him that he was mistaken they had no money to throw away on driving And the people who had not meant to helpthe Miss Lavishes the Cecils the Miss Bartletts Ever prone to magnify Fate George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment Anything good in Freddys letter Not yet His own content was absolute but hers held bitterness the Honeychurches had not forgiven them they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy she had alienated Windy Corner perhaps for ever What does he say Silly boy He thinks hes being dignified He knew we should go off in the springhe has known it for six monthsthat if mother wouldnt give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands They had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement Ridiculous boy Signorino domani faremo uno giro But it will all come right in the end He has to build us both up from the beginning again I wish though that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women He has for the second time quite altered Why will men have theories about women I havent any about men I wish too that Mr Beebe You may well wish that He will never forgive usI mean he will never be interested in us again I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner I wish he hadntBut if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run Perhaps Then he said more gently Well I acted the truththe only thing I did doand you came back to me So possibly you know He turned back into the room Nonsense with that sock He carried her to the window so that she too saw all the view They sank upon their knees invisible from the road they hoped and began to whisper one anothers names Ah it was worth while it was the great joy that they had expected and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt They were silent Signorino domani faremo Oh bother that man But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said No dont be rude to him Then with a catching of her breath she murmured Mr Eager and Charlotte dreadful frozen Charlotte How cruel she would be to a man like that Look at the lights going over the bridge But this room reminds me of Charlotte How horrible to grow old in Charlottes way To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldnt have heard your father was in the house For she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense You couldnt have made me When I am very happyshe kissed himI remember on how little it all hangs If Charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and I should have gone to silly Greece and become different for ever But she did know said George she did see my father surely He said so Oh no she didnt see him She was upstairs with old Mrs Beebe dont you remember and then went straight to the church She said so George was obstinate again My father said he saw her and I prefer his word He was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was Miss Bartlett A few minutes before you came in She was turning to go as he woke up He didnt speak to her Then they spoke of other thingsthe desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another and whose reward is to rest quietly in each others arms It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting George who disliked any darkness said Its clear that she knew Then why did she risk the meeting She knew he was there and yet she went to church They tried to piece the thing together As they talked an incredible solution came into Lucys mind She rejected it and said How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment But something in the dying evening in the roar of the river in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life and George whispered Or did she mean it Mean what Signorino domani faremo uno giro Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness Lascia prego lascia Siamo sposati Scusi tanto signora he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse Buona serae grazie Niente The cabman drove away singing Mean what George He whispered Is it this Is this possible Ill put a marvel to you That your cousin has always hoped That from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like thisof course very far down That she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped I cant explain her any other way Can you Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable The sight of us haunted heror she couldnt have described us as she did to her friend There are detailsit burnt I read the book afterwards She is not frozen Lucy she is not withered up all through She tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy We can never make friends with her or thank her But I do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad It is impossible murmured Lucy and then remembering the experiences of her own heart she said Noit is just possible Youth enwrapped them the song of Phaethon announced passion requited love attained But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this The song died away they heard the river bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK

Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machinereadable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations 1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations To donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility wwwgutenbergorg This website includes information about Project Gutenbergtm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks'"
